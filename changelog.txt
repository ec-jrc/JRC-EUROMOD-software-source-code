Compared to previous release v.3.5.2, this software version includes the following updates/changes:
- Core software:
	- Fixed a bug where distributional statistics were not properly read from the country file

	- Made sure that ils_extstat_other is read only at first level (not recursively disentagling the component ils)
	- Improved the combobox options in the Destination column of external statistics.
	- ils_extstat_other row is completely hidden in the statistics if there is no component to show in the current table. 
	- Added the "AutoRenameWhenCopying" parameter which decides whether filenames should be auto-renamed in DefInput & DefOutput functions when copying/renaming a system (required for ITT).

EUROMOD v3.5.2
Compared to previous release v.3.5.1, this software version includes the following updates/changes:
- Core software:
	- Added support for the incomelist "ils_extstat_other" which you can define in "IlsDef_cc" in order to introduce other external statistics.
	- Added a new column in the External Statistics where you can define the "destination" of an ils component for the aggregates (not for distributional). For all default ils in the aggregates, you should see only the default destination of "None" and for the "ils_extstat_other" you should see all available destinations.
	- The produced statistics report now includes the variables you selected. Each aggregate table will also include "ils_extstat_other" in the end, whether it shows as empty or not. Every ils that has at least one component hidden, displays a relevant warning in the ils header. 
	- The external statistics are also available in the spine in teh form of constants. The aggregate statistics are available as "$extstat_number_*" and "$extstat_amount_*", while the distributional and poverty statistics are available as "$extstat_*".
