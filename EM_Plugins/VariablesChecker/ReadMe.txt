ReadMe VariablesChecker.cs - Plug-in for checking EUROMOD variables
=====================================================================

Each of the buttons in the dialog performs a separate test.
The tooltip of the button tells what is checked.

The file tested is the varialbes file (VarConfig.xml) of the EUROMOD-version the user interface displays.

Outputs are written to a folder "ResultsVariablesCheck" in the output folder of this EURMOD-version.

Each button produces one text-file with problems, unless no problems were found.
