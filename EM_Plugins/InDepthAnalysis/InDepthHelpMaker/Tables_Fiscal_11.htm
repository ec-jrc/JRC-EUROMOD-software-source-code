    <h1>Fiscal Tables</h1>

    <h4>1.1. Revenue-expenditure</h4>
    <h6>Description</h6>
    <p>
        The Table shows, on an annual base, aggregate original income, government revenue and government expenditure.<br />
        In addition the last row displays the net budgetary effect, i.e. the change of a scenario's government budget (revenue minus expenditure)
        with respect to the reference scenario.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following aggregates are displayed:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Total earnings (ils_earns)</li>
            <li>Other original income (ils_origy - ils_earns)</li>
            <li>Total taxes (ils_tax)</li>
            <li>Total SIC (ils_sicdy + ils_sicer)</li>
            <li>Total pensions (ils_pen)</li>
            <li>Total means tested benefits (ils_benmt)</li>
            <li>Total non-means tested benefits (ils_bennt)</li>
            <li>Net budgetary effect (taxes + SSC - pensions - benefits)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The values are assessed as a weighted sum of the EUROMOD income list variables (indicated in brackets) in the respective baseline/reform output file.<br />
        Moreover, each aggregate, except from b and h, is decomposed into the single variables that build the respective income lists.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Some facts upon assessing the required information may be helpful to understand the table.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
        <li>
            The information upon EUROMOD income lists is taken from the EUROMOD project indicated in the field <i>EUROMOD project folder</i> in the
            <a href="Settings_Main.htm">main settings dialogue</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The decomposition is omitted if no such information is available (e.g. if the country or system could not be identified in the EUROMOD project).<br />
            The tool uses the EUROMOD log file, supposed to be found at the same path as the output file, to identify the system.
            If no log file is available, the tool tries to extract the system name from the output file name.
        </li>
        <li>
            No decomposition is displayed, if more than one country is analysed.
        </li>
        <li>
            In interpreting EUROMOD income lists, the tool accounts for EUROMOD extensions.
            The EUROMOD log file is used to assess the extension settings applied to generate the respective output file.
            If no log file is available, default extension settings are assumed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The tool does not take into account whether the output was generated with add-ons or not.
        </li>
        <li>
            The tool assumes &lsquo;simple&rsquo; income list definition, i.e. that variables are either added (+) or subtracted (-). 
            That means, that factors like +0.5 or -2 are ignored and just considered as added or subtracted, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note that the sum of components and the value of the displayed sum (assessed via income list variables) will rarely be exactly equal.
            This is due to multiplying numbers in the output files, which by default have two decimal precission, with (possibly large) weights.
            Consequently, the preciseness of the match will increase with the number of decimals used for generating the output files.<br />
            Nevertheless, as there are likely cases, where the sum of components and the total may not match due to reasons other than rounding 
			(e.g. if no log file is available to assess extension settings),
            the tool performs a respective check and issues a warning if the percentage difference ((reform-base)/base) is larger than 0.00005.
        </li>
        <li>
            A last note, summarising the advantages of the availability of a log file:
            <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
                <li>The output file can be renamed, as the log file works with file-codes instead of file names.</li>
                <li>Finding the system name is not dependent on the output file having a standard name (i.e. cc_yyyy_std.txt).</li>
                <li>Extension settings of the concrete run are taken into account.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
