    <h1>Distributional Tables</h1>

    <h4>General arguments</h4>

    <h6>Breakdown</h6>
    <p>
        All Distributional Tables show results for the whole population, as well as broken down over an &lsquo;argument&rsquo; splitting the population into groups.<br />
        There are two ways to define this argument:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>
                by a variable with a restricted number of values<br />
                For example:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>the variable <i>dgn</i> (gender) will generate two rows, one with results for men and the other with results for women</li>
                    <li>the variable <i>drgn1</i> (region nuts level 1) will generate one row with results for each region</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                by quantiles of a variable<br />
                For, example:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>
                        the variable <i>ils_dispy</i> (disposable income) together with the option <i>quantiles</i> set to 5 and
                        the option <i>equivalised</i> to yes, will generate five rows, one with results for each quintile of equivalised individual disposable income
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the variable <i>yem</i> (employment income) together with the option <i>quantiles</i> set to 2 and
                        the option <i>equivalised</i> to no, will generate two rows, one with results for the units with employment income below the median
                        and the other with results for the units with employment income above the median
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples (a) and (b) require further explanation, if the level of analysis is the Household.<br />
        In example (a) the gender variable is taken from the first person in the household (in the output file).
        That means the population is split into a group of households with the first person being a man and a group with the first person being a woman.<br />
        For the interpretation of example (b), note that <b><span style="color:darksalmon">quantiles are, independent of any level of analysis setting, always build on
        individual level</span></b>, i.e. n groups of individuals are built (opposed to n groups of households).
        As for example (a), the resulting quantile-variable is taken from the first person in the household.<br />
        Thus, for both examples, analysis on household level delivers rather questionable results.
        Moreover, in example (b), with any level of analysis, the target population should probably be restricted to units with non-zero employment income.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the <b><span style="color:darksalmon">breakdown always refers to variables of the baseline</span></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also note that, if there are no units taking a certain value of a variable, no row is displayed for this value.
        If, for example, decile 6, does not have any members in the selected population, the row for decile 6 is omitted.

        See <a href="Settings_Distributional.htm">Distributional settings / Changing population breakdown</a> for instructions on how to
        define breakdowns in the settings dialogue.
    </p>

    <h6>Target population</h6>
    <p>
        For all Distributional Tables the respective results can be restricted to a specific target population (separately for each Table).<br />
        For a description and examples on how to define the respective condition see
        <a href="Tables.htm">General arguments / Conditions</a>.<br />
        Note that the condition is evaluated at the <i>Level of analysis</i> selected for the Table.
