<h1>Identifiers and the placeholders =cc= and =sys=</h1>

<h4>Placeholders</h4>

<p>EUROMOD add-ons are commonly designed for being used with not
just one country, but with several or all countries. (For more information on
add-ons see <a href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD Functions - EUROMOD
add-ons and the special functions AddOn_Applic, AddOn_Pol, AddOn_Func and AddOnPar</a>.) In implementing them it is sometimes necessary
to refer to components of the tax-benefit implementations, which are in
principle common, but have country- or system-dependent specifications. As a
typical example, all countries have some definition of the assessment unit
household, but specifications (e.g. who is a child) differ, therefore the
respective assessment units are called tu_household_ee,
tu_household_uk, etc. To
be still able to refer to them all at once the placeholder =cc=
can be used, e.g. tu_household_=cc=. The model will replace the placeholders by the
respective country acronym at runtime. As another typical example an add-on may
produce a special output. In order to not overwrite this output if the add-on
is run for several systems, one may want to us <i>someoutput_=sys=</i> as filename (parameter <i>File</i>
of function <i><a href="EM_FC_DefOutput.htm">DefOutput</a></i>). Again the model will replace the
placeholder by the respective system name at runtime, e.g. <i>someoutput_UK_2012</i>. In principle the placeholders not only can be
used with add-ons but in each parameter file (though probably seldom
necessary).</p>

<h4>Identifiers</h4>

<p>Each EUROMOD policy, function and parameter possesses a
unique identifier in the form of a GUID<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.
More precisely, identifiers are system specific, which means that each policy,
function or parameter possesses one unique identifier per system. These unique
identifiers are assigned once a component is created and kept for the whole
lifetime of the component.</p>

<p>In addition each policy, function and parameter possesses a
&quot;symbolic identifier&quot;. The symbolic identifier of policies is simply
their name. The symbolic identifier of a function is composed of the name of
the policy where the function is located and the order of the function,
separated by _#. For example <i>tin_es_#3</i>
refers to the third function in the Spanish income tax policy (<i>tin_es</i>). The
symbolic identifier of a parameter is composed of the name of the policy where
the parameter is located, the order of the function containing the parameter
and the order of the parameter itself, the former order again separated by _#
and the latter by a point. For example <i>tin_es_#3.7</i>
refers to the seventh parameter in the third function of the Spanish income tax
policy.</p>

<p>Symbolic identifiers are constructed somewhat different for
the functions <i><a href="EM_FC_DefIL.htm">DefIL</a></i> and <i><a
href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst.htm">DefTU</a></i>. Instead of the
order of the function the incomelist’s or taxunit’s name is used. For example <i>ildef_bg_#ils_dispy</i>
refers to the function defining disposable income for Bulgaria (more precisely
the <i>DefIL</i>
function in the policy <i>ildef_bg</i>
with parameter <i>name</i> set to <i>ils_dispy</i>). Similarily <i>tudef_bg_#tu_household_bg.3</i>
refers to the third parameter in the function defining the Bulgarian household
concept (<i>tu_household_bg</i>). This sort
of referencing allows an add-on for example to add components to incomelists which exist for all countries, e.g. a benefit
or tax calculated by the add on can be made part of
standard disposable income.</p>

<p>Due to their construction symbolic identifiers are not
system specific and, though unique at a certain time, may change with
alterations of the order of functions or parameters or the renaming of a
policy. The reason for still preferring them over the more secure unique
identifiers is similar to the usage of placeholders, i.e. they are not supposed
to refer to something unique but to several countries or systems. </p>

<p>Identifiers are used by several functions, most frequently
by the <i>AddOn_xxx</i>
functions, but also by the loop functions and <i>ChangeParam</i>. For an example see <a
href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD Functions - EUROMOD add-ons and the
special functions AddOn_Applic, AddOn_Pol,
AddOn_Func and AddOnPar</a>.
<strong>Please note that symbolic identifiers
can only be used within add-ons!</strong> Within country implementations please use
unique identifiers.</p>

<p>To use an identifier right click the respective policy,
function or parameter and select either <i>Copy
Identifier</i> or <i>Copy Symbolic
Identifier</i> from the context menu. This copies the respective identifier to
the clipboard, from where it can be pasted to the required location.</p>

<p>If you prefer the "manual" way to create identifiers, this summary of syntax may help:<br>
General: PolicyName[_#FunctionNumber][.ParameterNumber] (examples: tin_es, tin_es_#3, tin_es_#3.7)<br>
DefIL: PolicyName_#IncomelistName[.ParameterNumber] (examples: ildef_bg_#ils_dispy, ildef_bg_#ils_dispy.6)<br>
DefTU: PolicyName_#TaxunitName[.ParameterNumber] (examples: tudef_bg_#tu_household_bg, tudef_bg_#tu_household_bg.3)<br>
