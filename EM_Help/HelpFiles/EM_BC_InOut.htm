<h1>EUROMOD input and output</h1>

<p>EUROMOD output is essentially based on two inputs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>household micro-data and</li>

<li>EUROMOD <i>parameters</i>, which store rules on how to calculate taxes and benefits</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these two information sources the model calculates all
taxes and benefits that lend themselves for simulation. For example the income
tax is calculated by taking the income the tax is based on from the dataset and
applying the tax rules stored in the EUROMOD <i>parameters</i>, e.g. the tax schedule, on this base. These calculations
are carried out for each household in the dataset and the result is written to
a micro-output file. The output is at the individual level. It should however
be taken into account that some of the results, for example family benefits,
only make sense on household or family level. In such cases the benefit is
usually assigned to the head of the assessment unit.</p>

<p>The main output of the model - disposable income for each
household in the dataset - is made up of elements taken from the survey data -
basically earnings and original income from other sources, as well as taxes and
benefits that are not simulated - combined with taxes and benefits that are
simulated by the model. The most common reason for not simulating a tax or
benefit is lack of information, e.g. most pensions cannot be calculated by the
model as the datasets usually do not contain information on past contributions
to the pension system.</p>

<p>For each country implemented in EUROMOD there are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>one or more dataset(s), i.e. survey data collected in different years and</li>
<li>one or more <i>system(s)</i>, i.e. tax-benefit rules for different policy years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, to calculate taxes and benefits for the year 2010
one would use the 2010 policy rules together with data referring to the year
2010. However, corresponding data is not always available and even if so,
preparing and integrating new data in the model is a very laborious task.
Therefore datasets are used for simulating several policy years, by up-dating monetary
values to the corresponding policy year. Usually, for each <i>system</i> there is a dataset that is most suitable, normally the one
whose collection year is nearest to the policy year. These optimal <i>system</i>-dataset combinations are referred
to as <i>best match</i>. The EUROMOD <i>run dialog</i> shows
which data and <i>systems</i> can be
combined and which of these combinations are optimal. For further information
on the EUROMOD <i>run dialog</i> and how to
produce output with EUROMOD see <a href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with
EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>.</p>

<p>EUROMOD stores its output in text
files. As a default a standard output file is produced, which is called <i>cc_YYYY_std.txt</i>. <i>cc</i> stands for the country short name and <i>YYYY</i> stands for the tax-benefit year, e.g. <i>hu_2010_std.txt</i> if the output is based on the 2010 rules of the
Hungarian tax-benefit system.</p>

<p>The output contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>identification numbers, household identifier (idhh), person identifier (idperson),
identifiers of parents (idmother, idfather)
and partner (idpartner)</li>
<li>sample weight (dwt), which is the same for all household members</li>
<li>demographic information, e.g. age (dag), gender (dgn), level of
education (dec), economic status (les), etc.</li>
<li>monthly original income (ils_origy)</li>
<li>monthly disposable income (ils_dispy)</li>
<li>other important aggregates on monthly basis, e.g. taxes (ils_tax),
benefits (ils_ben), employee, employer and
self-employed social insurance contributions (ils_sicee,
ils_sicer, ils_sicse),
earnings (ils_earns), public pensions (ils_pen), etc.</li>
<li>several other informative variables (simulated
or taken from data, demographic or monetary) and monetary aggregates</li>
<li>possibly information on
special assessment units, e.g. the inner family, (HeadID,
IsDependentChild, IsParnter,
etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>EUROMOD <strong><i>Country Reports</i></strong> document
the way in which each country's tax-benefit system is modelled, i.e. the
EUROMOD <i>parameters</i>. For further

effects of taxes and benefits in the EU, calculated by EUROMOD, can be viewed
