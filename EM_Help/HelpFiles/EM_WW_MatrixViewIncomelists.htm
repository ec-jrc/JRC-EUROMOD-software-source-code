<h1>Matrix view of incomelists</h1>

<p>The &quot;matrix view&quot; of a system's incomelists shows a
tabulate view of this system's incomelists, where the headers of the columns
contain the names of the incomelists and the headers of the rows contain the
names of all variables included in any incomelist. The cells at the crossing
points contain the &quot;contribution&quot; of the respective variable to the
respective incomelist, e.g. 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5.</p>

<p>The view is opened by right clicking a system, to open its<i> </i>context menu, and selecting the menu
item <i>Show Matrix View of Incomelists</i>.
Another option to open the view is by clicking the button <i>Show Matrix View of Incomelists</i> in the ribbon <i>Display</i> and selecting the respective system from the appearing
list.</p>

<p>Note that the window showing the matrix view of incomelists
is non-modal, that means the window can stay open while editing. Use respective
resizing, the <i>minimise</i>, <i>maximise</i> and <i>close</i> button to position the window where it is convenient.</p>
