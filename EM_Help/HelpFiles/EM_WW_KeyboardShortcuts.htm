<h1>Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>

<p>As it happens with most software applications, EUROMOD also understands a number of keyboard shortcuts
that, once you get used to, will help you increase your productivity. Following is a list of keyboard 
shortcuts that are generally available, both in the Country spine and in other forms (e.g. Uprating Indices).</p>

<table class="info">
	<tr>
		<th>Keyboard Shortcut</th>
		<th>Usage</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + Z</td>
		<td>Undo the latest action. EUROMOD can store up to 100 actions, after which, the oldest action 
		is removed to make space for the new action. There are also specific actions that reset the 
		undo/redo functionality. These will issue a warning before they are applied and the user can 
		chose to abort them.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + Y</td>
		<td>Redo the latest undone action.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Shift + Arrows</td>
		<td>Starting from the current cell, it will select an area of cells that can be copied.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + C, Ctrl + Ins</td>
		<td>Copy the selected items into the clipboard. This works for text within cells, but also for whole cells 
		both in the spine and helping forms. The user may select multiple cells / parameters 
		/ functions / policies, by holding the Shift button and selecting the start & end location with 
		the mouse.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + X, Shift + Del</td>
		<td>Cut the selected text or cells and copy them into the clipboard. Note that this does not work 
		for parameters / functions / policies. It only works for selected text within a cell and for tables 
		within helping forms (such as Uprating Indices). Multiple selection works as for Copy.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + V, Shift + Ins</td>
		<td>Paste the copied items into the current position. Note that this will not create new rows in the spine.
		So if you need to copy-paste several parameters of one function into another, please make sure that it already 
		has the same number of parameters and in the same order.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F1</td>
		<td>Brings up the help. If the focus is on helping form, the help will try to automatically load the 
		corresponding page. For function-specific help, see at the end of the following table.</td>
	</tr>

<p>Following is a list of keyboard shortcuts that are specific to the country spine.</p>
<table class="info">
	<tr>
		<th>Keyboard Shortcut</th>
		<th>Usage</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + F</td>
		<td>This will bring up the "Search" form.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + H</td>
		<td>This will bring up the "Search and Replace" form.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + S</td>
		<td>Save the current state of the country you are working on.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + Right arrow, "+"</td>
		<td>Expand the current function or policy. Note that if you are on a parameter cell, pressing "+" will 
		start editing the cell and add the "+" character (Ctrl + Right arrow will do nothing in this case, as 
		there is nothing to expand).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + Left arrow, "-"</td>
		<td>Collapse the current function or policy. Note that if you are on a parameter cell, pressing "-" will 
		start editing the cell and add the "-" character. Pressing Ctrl + Left while on a parameter or an already 
		collapsed function will move the focus to the parent function/policy.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/</td>
		<td>Collapse the current item and all sub-items. On a function works like "-", but on a policy it will 
		collapse both the policy and all functions within it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>*</td>
		<td>Expand the current item and all sub-items. On a function works like "+", but on a policy it will 
		expand both the policy and all functions within it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + Up arrow, Ctrl + Down arrow</td>
		<td>Move the current parameter / function / policy up or down respectively. Note that moving parameters 
		cannot move outside their parent function and similarly moving functions cannot be moved outside their 
		parent policy. Also works with moving an area selection. Another way to move parameters / functions / 
		policies up & down is to click & drag them with the mouse.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Alt + O</td>
		<td>Hide all rows but the selected one. This will hide only rows of the selected level, so pressing it 
		when the focus is on a parameter will hide all other parameters of that function only. You can find more 
		options to hide & unhide rows, by right-clicking on the row numbers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Alt + S</td>
		<td>Spread the value of the current cell on all other systems. The focus must be on a system column.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ctrl + A</td>
		<td>Open the "Add Parameters" box in order to add more parameters into the current function. The focus 
		must be on a function or parameter.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F5</td>
		<td>Brings up the help and automatically loads the "Description" help page for the focused function.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F6</td>
		<td>Brings up the help and automatically loads the "Summary of parameters" help page for the focused function.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
