<h1>Saving changes</h1>

<p>To save your changes open the main menu (above the button <i>Run EUROMOD</i>) and select the menu item <i>Save</i>.
Alternatively press <i>Ctrl-S</i>. For
further information on file organisation and structure see <a
href="EM_FS_OrganisationOfFiles.htm">EUROMOD Installation and File Structure</a>.</p>

<h4>Saving a copy of a country</h4>

<p>To generate a copy of a country select the menu item <i>Save As</i> from the main menu (above the <i>Run EUROMOD</i> button). This opens a dialog
allowing indicating the <i>Long Name</i> and the <i>Short Name</i> of the copied country.
The former is the countries full name (e.g. Hungary, Spain, MySpain, etc.), the latter is the country code (e.g. HU, ES, MS, etc.). 
Note that the country code needs to be unique, i.e. no other country with this code exists yet.<br>
Moreover, you are asked to indicate a <i>Flag</i> in portable network graphic format (png). Ideally the size of the image is 28x17 pixels.
You can also select the image with the file search dialog opened by pressing the button alongside the <i>Flag</i> field.
If you do not indicate a flag image, the flag of the origin country will be used.<br>
If the checkbox <i>Advanced Adaptations</i> is not ticked <i>Save As</i> simply copies the country's parameter files without any further adaptation. 
Ticking the box effects also adapting the content of the files (e.g. changing system- and policy-names to reflect the short name of the copied country) 
and possibly global settings (HICP, exchange rates). The user can define what is changed concretely by opening a configuration dialog (i.e. clicking the button &hellip;). 
The comments in the dialog also explain the changes.</p>

<p>Once the specifications are confirmed with <i>OK</i> the copy of the country is displayed in the country gallery (ribbon <i>Countries</i>)
and can be loaded and edited as any other country. Note that, after <i>Save As</i>, the loaded country is the copied. 
The origin country is not loaded anymore and has the status of the last saving before the <i>Save As</i>.</p>

<p>For information on the files, which are generated by the copy process see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture</a>.</p>

<h4>Auto-saving</h4>

<p>The user interface provides an auto-saving feature, which
automatically saves changes to a country's parameter files in configurable
intervals of time. The changes are not saved in the original country's parameter
files but in temporary files called <i>astmp_cc.xml</i>
and <i>astmp_cc_DataConfig.xml</i> and
stored in the temporary folder (see <a href="EM_FS_OrganisationOfFiles.htm">EUROMOD
Installation and File Structure</a>). If the user interface fails to load a
country it suggests using these files if existent.</p>

<p>To configure the auto-saving interval, or to en- or disable
auto-saving, select the menu item <i>Configuration</i>
from the main menu (above the <i>Run EUROMOD</i>
button). The tab <i>Auto Save</i> of the
appearing dialog allows for defining these settings.</p>

<h4>File locking</h4>

<p>In order to avoid that several developers change a country
at the same time, the user interface uses a locking mechanism.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
That means once a developer opens a country &quot;normally&quot;, i.e. in
read-write modes, any further developer who opens the same country, gets an is-in-use-message,
which tells who is using the country and asks whether the country should be
opened in read-only modus. The user interface allows for three reactions to
this message: Firstly, with pressing 'Yes' the country is opened in read-only
modus, meaning that saving is disabled. Secondly, with pressing 'Cancel' the
developer decides to not open the country. Thirdly, with pressing 'No', the
country is opened &quot;normally&quot;, i.e. in read-write modes. This last
option is foreseen for cases, where due to an unforeseen event the locking of
the country was not removed after closing it, i.e. locking is irrelevant.
Developers should however be aware that the option allows for actually
overwriting other developers changes or getting once own changes overwritten -
it must therefore be used with care.</p>

<p>Please note that file locking is not only applied on
countries but also on add-ons and on the variables file.</p>

Technically the user interface generates a small text file alongside the
parameter files, which contains information on who uses the country. The file
is deleted once the country is closed again.</p>
