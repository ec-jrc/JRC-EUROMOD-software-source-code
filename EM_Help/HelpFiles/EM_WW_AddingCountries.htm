<h1>Adding new Countries/Add-ons</h1>

<h4>Adding countries</h4>

<p>To add a new country to EUROMOD select the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> and click the
button <i>Add Country</i>. This opens a
dialog allowing indicating the <i>Long Name</i>
and the <i>Short Name</i> of the country.
The former is the countries full name (e.g. Hungary, Germany, Greece, Spain,
etc.), the latter is the country code (e.g. HU, DE,
EL, ES, etc.).</p>

<p>Moreover, you are asked to indicate a <i>Flag</i> in portable network graphic format (png).
Ideally the size of the image is 28x17 pixels. You can also select the image
with the file search dialog opened by pressing the button alongside the <i>Flag</i> field. If you do not indicate a
flag image, a default image with a question mark will be used.</p>

<p>Confirming the specifications with <i>OK</i> adds the country and instructs you to go to the country gallery
(i.e. the ribbon <i>Countries</i>) to load
the new country. For information on the files, which are created by the add
process see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Installation and
Architecture</a>.</p>

<h4>Adding add-ons</h4>

<p>You may have noted that the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> contains a button for deleting add-ons but no
button for adding add-ons. This is due to the fact that add-ons are usually not
generated from scratch but either exported from a country (see <a
href="EM_WW_ImportingExportingAddOns.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Importing and
exporting add-ons</a>) or created by adapting an existing add-on (see <a
href="EM_WW_Saving.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Saving, saving as and auto-saving</a>).</p>
