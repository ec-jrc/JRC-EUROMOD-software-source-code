<h1>Sorts of functions and brief description of available functions</h1>

<p>One could classify EUROMOD functions into three categories:
policy functions, system functions and special functions.</p>

<h4>Policy functions</h4>

<p>These functions are primarily
designed for implementing policy instruments (taxes and benefits). The category
contains the following functions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Elig</strong>
	is referred to as eligibility function as it is most frequently used for
	determining the eligibility for receiving benefits. However, it also allows for
	determining the liability for paying taxes, as well as evaluating other
	conditions.</li>

	<li><strong>BenCalc</strong>
	is referred to as the benefit calculator, as it allows for modelling a wide
	range of policy instruments, in particular benefits.</li>

	<li><strong>ArithOp</strong>
	is a simple calculator, allowing for the most common arithmetical operations.</li>

	<li><strong>SchedCalc</strong>
	allows for the implementation of the most common (tax) schedules.</li>

	<li><strong>Allocate</strong>
	allows for (re)allocating amounts (incomes, benefits, taxes) between members of
	assessment units.</li>

	<li><strong>Min and Max</strong> are simple minimum and maximum calculators.</li>
</ul>

<h4>System functions</h4>

<p>These functions are designed for
implementing the &quot;framework&quot; of the tax-benefit model. A country’s
parameter file contains several special policies to implement this framework.
The section <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts -
Presentation of countries' tax-benefit-systems</a> provides more information
about these special EUROMOD policies and their purpose. Usually, the
implementation of a special policy uses just one or two particular system
functions. The category contains the following functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Uprate</strong>
	is used in the special policy Uprate_cc and allows
	for the uprating of monetary dataset variables.</li>

	<li><strong>SetDefault</strong>
	allows for the setting of default values for not existent dataset variables.</li>

	<li><strong>DefIL</strong>
	is mainly used in the special policy ILDef_cc and
	allows for the definition of incomelists (see <a href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD
	Basic Concepts - EUROMOD terminology</a>).</li>

	<li><strong>DefTU</strong>
	is mainly used in the special policy TUDef_cc and
	allows for the definition of assessment units (see <a
	href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - EUROMOD terminology</a>).</li>

	<li><strong>UpdateTU </strong>allows
	for the redefinition of assessment units.</li>

	<li><strong>DefOutput</strong>
	is used in the special policies output_xx_cc and
	allows for the definition of model output (see <a href="EM_BC_InOut.htm">EUROMOD
	Basic Concepts - EUROMOD input and output</a>).</li>

	<li><strong>DefVar</strong>
	and <strong>DefConst</strong> allow for the
	definition of intermediate variables respectively constants, which can be used
	by other (mostly policy) functions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Special functions</h4>

<p>These functions go beyond the
implementation of the tax-benefit system. The category contains the following
functions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Loop</strong>
	and <strong>UnitLoop</strong> allow for repeating
	part (or all) of the tax-benefit calculations. As an example, for calculating
	marginal tax rates at least part of the policies need to be calculated twice,
	once for original income and once for marginally increased income.</li>

	<li><strong>Store</strong>
	and <strong>Restore</strong> are mainly, though not
	exclusively, designed to be used with the loop functions described above, as it
	is frequently necessary to set some or all variables back to their initial (or
	some other previous) value after each iteration.</li>

	<li><strong>ChangeParam</strong>
	allows for changing the value parameters. It also can, for example, be used for
	more transparent implementation of policy reforms, by avoiding direct changes
	of the base policy parameters and putting the alterations in separate reform
	policies instead.</li>

	<li><strong>Totals</strong>
	allows for the calculation of aggregates (i.e. sums, means, etc.) of variables
	or incomelists over the whole population (represented by the dataset) or a
	selected subgroup.</li>

	<li><strong>DropUnit</strong>
	and <strong>KeepUnit</strong> allow for dropping
	(keeping only) individuals, families or households with special characteristics
	from (within) the calculations.</li>

	<li><strong>ILVarOp</strong>
	allows for operations on the content, i.e. the variables of an incomelist.</li>

	<li><strong>RandSeed</strong>
	sets the starting point for generating a series of pseudorandom numbers.</li>

	<li><strong>CallProgramme</strong>
	allows for calling an external application.</li>

	<li><strong>DefInput</strong>
	allows for reading values for one or more EUROMOD variables from a text file.</li>
</ul>
