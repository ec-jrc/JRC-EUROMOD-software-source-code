<h1>Comparing systems</h1>

<p>The user interface allows comparing two systems by
highlighting the differences with a specific background colour. Respective
options are provided by a dialog, which is opened by right clicking the system,
which is compared with another one to open the system's context menu and
selecting the menu item <i>Compare System
with</i>. Note that differences are highlighted in this system.</p>

<p>The dialog allows selecting the <strong>comparison system</strong> and
the <strong>colour for highlighting</strong> and offers the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Expand Differences:</i></strong>
If the box is checked, in addition to highlighting parameters, which show
different values for the two systems, the functions and policies they belong to
are expanded to make differences immediately visible.</li>

<li><strong><i>Align Side by Side:</i></strong>
If the box is checked, the comparison system is moved to the right of the system
it is compared to, to facilitate checking what the difference is.</li>

<li><strong><i>Clear Current Marker:</i></strong> If the box is checked, the highlighting of a possible former
comparison is removed before highlighting the differences of the current
comparison. Not checking the box, i.e. keeping the results of a former
comparison, and possibly using a different highlighting colour, may be useful
to compare the system with more than one comparison system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that any conditional formatting (see <a
href="EM_WW_ConditionalFormatting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Conditional
formatting</a>) is removed before the comparison.</p>

<p>Also note that the highlighting of a comparison is removed, and conditional formatting reinstalled, by any
change (e.g. changing a <i>parameter</i>
value, adding a <i>function</i>, etc.).
Moreover, the <i>system context menu's</i>
item <strong><i>Remove Comparison Marker</i></strong>
allows removing the highlighting of a comparison without reinstalling the
conditional formatting.</p>
