<h1>EUROMOD
PLUGINS</h1>

<p>
Plug-ins are software components that extend the functionality of EUROMOD. While the core user interface concentrates on supporting the implementation, adaptation and running of countries' tax-benefit systems, plug-ins provide additional features like producing basic summary statistics, performing microvalidation, or generating hypothetical datasets. In the official release of v1.10 the only publicly available plug-in is the "Summary Statistics", but many more will be added in future releases to accommodate task-specific needs.
