<h1>Importing & Exporting add-ons</h1>

<h4>Importing add-ons</h4>

<p>To import an add-on, select the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and click the button <i>Import Add-On</i>. In the appearing dialog first select one of the
add-ons listed in the combo-box. Once an add-on is selected, the systems of
this add-on are listed in the left box. Select the add-on system you want to
import. Once an add-on system is selected, the right box lists all systems of
the country which can be used as base for the selected add-on system. Select
one of the systems and click OK. This generates the respective add-on system
and imports it into the country. For further information on importing systems
see <a href="EM_WW_ImportingExportingSystems.htm">Working with EUROMOD -
Importing and exporting systems</a>. For further information on add-ons see <a
href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD functions - EUROMOD add-ons and the
special functions <i>AddOn_Applic</i><i>, AddOn_Pol, AddOn_Func</i> and <i>AddOnPar</i></a>.</p>

<h4>Exporting add-ons</h4>

<p>To export an add-on, select the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and click the button <i>Export Add-On</i>. The appearing dialog asks for the following
information respectively offers the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long Name:</strong> Indicate a descriptive name for the add-on (e.g.
marginal tax rates).</li>

<li><strong>Short Name:</strong> Indicate a short name for the add-on, which will be
displayed in the add-on gallery. Ideally use two or three-character
abbreviations (e.g. MTR). Note that you cannot use an abbreviation, which is
already in use for another add-on, nor the short name of a country (i.e. AT, BE, ..., UK).</li>

<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Indicate a picture in portable network graphic format (png). Ideally the size of the image is 32x32 pixels. You
can also select the image with the file search dialog opened by pressing the
button alongside the <i>Symbol</i> field. If
you do not indicate a symbol, a default image will be used.</li>

<li><strong>Add-On System / Base System:</strong> The
&quot;technique&quot; to generate the add-on is to identify the differences
between the indicated <i>Add-On System</i>
and <i>Base System</i>, in order to
summarise the differences in the add-on. That means, for example, if a policy
is only used in the add-on system but not in the base system, a respective <i>AddOn_Pol</i>
function is generated in the add-on. <span style='color:red'>Note that
&quot;not used&quot; in this context is identified by the switch of the base
system being set to <i>n/a</i></span>.
For further information on add-ons see <a href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD
functions - EUROMOD add-ons and the special functions <i>AddOn_Applic</i><i>, AddOn_Pol, AddOn_Func</i>
and <i>AddOnPar</i></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Use symbolic identifiers:</strong> If this option is not selected the
add-on refers to elements of the base system (policies, functions and
parameters) by their GUIDs (<strong>G</strong>lobally
<strong>U</strong>nique <strong>Id</strong>entifiers). This is the recommended approach if there are no
plans to use the add-on on for several systems or countries. If the option is
selected, the GUIDs are exchanged by not system specific symbolic identifiers.
However, developers need to be aware that symbolic identifiers use an
identification mechanism which is more flexible (e.g. it supports using the
add-on system for several systems or countries), but also less secure.
Particularly symbolic identifiers are not unique. For further information see <a
href="EM_FC_Placeholders.htm">EUROMOD Functions – Identifiers and the
placeholders =cc= and =sys=</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Use country placeholder:</strong> This option can be selected if the
add-on is to be used for several countries. It changes references to policy
names from e.g. <i>yse_sl</i>
to <i>yse</i><i>_=cc=</i>, and taxunit
parameters from e.g. <i>individual_sl</i>
to <i>individual_=cc=</i>. For further
information see <a href="EM_FC_Placeholders.htm">EUROMOD Functions –
Identifiers and the placeholders =cc= and =sys=</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Export and delete / Export only:</strong> If the former option is
selected, the add-on system is deleted after generating the add-on. Moreover,
the parameter file is &quot;cleaned&quot; (see the respective paragraph in <a
href="EM_WW_ImportingExportingSystems.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Importing and
exporting systems</a> for a description of the cleaning process). If the latter
option is used, the country’s parameter file is not changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Confirming the specifications with <i>OK</i> generates the respective add-on and instructs you to go to the
add-on gallery (i.e. the ribbon <i>Add-Ons</i>)
to view the new add-on.</p>

<p>Note that using the export mechanism for generating an
add-on that can be used for another country than the one it was extracted from
must be seen as a starting point only. It is most likely that the developer,
after exporting, has to do some adaptions to make the add-on &quot;multi
country compliant&quot;. As an example, the export mechanism may link an add-on
policy, which is located before the standard output policy to the last country
(specific) policy (by using <i>Insert_After_Pol</i>) instead of the (common) standard output
policy (by using <i>Insert_Before_Pol</i>).
Also the above mentioned insecurity of using symbolic identifiers (and, though
less critical, country placeholders), should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Also note that the changes caused by importing or exporting
add-ons cannot be undone by using the undo functionality. However, the user
interface produces a backup before starting the action, which can be restored
via the button <i>Restore</i> in the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i>. For more information see
(<a href="EM_WW_BackupRestore.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Backup - Restore</a>).</p>
