<h1>Selecting components and values</h1>

<p>There are a number of operations which can be applied on
several components (policies/functions/parameters) or values. For example one
can delete a range of parameters in one go or copy the values of several
parameters.</p>

<p>For this purpose it is necessary to select the respective
components and/or values, respectively the corresponding range of cells in the
display. This is accomplished by selecting the first cell of the range, and
then pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i>
key while selecting the last cell of the range. Light blue back colour will
show the selection.</p>

<p>The selected region can be 'manually' unselected by either
pressing the Escape-key or by selecting a cell outside the region. The
selection is also automatically cancelled by several other actions, in
particular actions, which cause (or risk causing) a 'broken' selection, i.e.
the selected cells are not placed in a single rectangle anymore (also see
below).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following notes and hints may be useful in understanding
how selecting works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'first' and 'last' cell of the selection
(which are to be selected by the user) build the top-left and bottom-right end
points of the selection, and the selection will contain all cells in between
them. It is however not necessary to select the top-left end point first. In
other words selecting from the cell in row A, column B to the cell in row X,
column Y leads to the same result as selecting from the cell in row X, column Y
to the cell in row A, column B.</li>

<li>The selection (and the related operation) does
only concern visible cells. Cells between the end points, which are hidden due
to collapsing or hidden columns, are not part of the selection. Therefore, to
avoid a 'broken' selection, any selection is cancelled by collapsing or
expanding.</li>

<li>Instead of using the mouse for selecting the
first and last cell of the selection the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) and
the position keys (page down, page up, etc.) can be used. The selection starts
when such a key is pressed together with the <i>Shift</i> key and ends once the <i>Shift</i>
key is released.</li>
