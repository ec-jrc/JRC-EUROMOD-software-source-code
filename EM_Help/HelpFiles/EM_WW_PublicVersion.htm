<h1>Generating a EUROMOD public
version</h1>

<p>A EUROMOD public version is a version that is released for
public use. Essentially, private countries/add-ons, systems, policies,
functions, parameters, datasets and comments are removed from such a version<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>,
i.e. parts, which are not yet ready or not foreseen to be visible to the
public.</p>

<p>User interface support for generating a EUROMOD public
version is available by selecting the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> and pressing the button <i>Public Version</i>. Note that a public version can only be generated if
all countries are closed. A respective message is issued if any country is
open. The appearing dialog allows for specifying a path for the public version,
as well as the version number. Note that both specifications are compulsory.
Pressing <i>OK</i>
starts the process<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title="">[2]</a>,
which, if terminated successfully, indicates where the public version was
stored. Note that the public version is not loaded. To check the result one has
to change the user interface's current &quot;content&quot; via the main menu's
item <i>Open project</i> (see <a
href="EM_WW_OpenProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Open project</a>).</p>

<p>To check which countries/add-ons, systems, policies,
functions, parameters and datasets are private before generating the public
version (or in fact whenever requested) click the dialog's button <i>Check Private</i>. This generates a simple
text file listing the private components. The file, called <i>PrivateComponents.txt</i>, is (preliminary) stored in the temporary
folder (see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Installation and
Architecture</a>) and opened after its generation.</p>

In addition all user-set colours are removed. Morover
default conditional formatting is installed (see <a
href="EM_WW_ConditionalFormatting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Conditional
Formatting</a> - paragraph &quot;Automatically setting the Base System Formatting&quot; and node that any formats, other than the
default are overwritten).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2"

The process generates a copy of the folder <i>EuromodFiles</i> (see <a
href="EM_FS_OrganisationOfFiles.htm">Installation and File Structure -
Organisation of files</a>) at the indicated path. This copy is then adapted by
removing all private systems, policies, functions and datasets. If all systems
of a country are private, the whole country is deleted.</p>
