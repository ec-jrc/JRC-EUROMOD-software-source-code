<h1>Deleting countries</h1>

<p>To delete one or more countries from EUROMOD select the
ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> and click
the button <i>Delete Country</i>. In the
appearing dialog select the countries you want to delete and confirm by
pressing the <i>Delete</i> button. Note that
the action is final and cannot be undone. Also note that the countries must not
be loaded - if they are an error message is issued.</p>

<p>For information on the files, which are deleted by the
process see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture</a>.</p>
