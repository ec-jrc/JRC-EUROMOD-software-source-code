<h1>Backup - Restore</h1>

<p>Some actions, like for example importing and exporting systems,
do not allow for undo (see <a href="EM_WW_Undo.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Undo
and redo</a>).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title="">[1]</a> However,
in order to still enable going back to the state before the action, the user
interface generates a backup of the XML-files, which allows for restoring this state.</p>

<h4>Backup</h4>

<p>Before the action starts, the user interface stores all
changes to the XML-files and clears the undo-list. The latter means that no previous
actions can be undone anymore. Then it generates the backup in form of a
folder, which is stored in the backup-folder of the user interface's temporary
folder (see <a href="EM_FS_OrganisationOfFiles.htm">EUROMOD Installation and
Architecture - EUROMOD content (parameter files) – Organisation of files</a>).
The folder is called <i>cc_yyyy</i><i>-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss</i>, for example <i>RO_2013-12-29_14-12-00</i>,
for a backup of Romania on the 29th December 2013, at twelve past two pm.<a

After the (successful) termination of the action the user interface issues a
message, which indicates the existence of the backup, how the file is called
and where it is stored. The message also informs about the possibility to
restore this version via the button <i>Restore</i>
in the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i>.</p>

<p>Note that backups are stored for three days in the temporary
folder. Older backups are automatically removed by the user interface.</p>

<h4>Restore</h4>

<p>Clicking the button <i>Restore</i>
in the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> opens a dialog
allowing for selecting the backup-folder as described in paragraph <i>Backup</i> above.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
Once the appropriate folder is selected, the user interface performs the restore
and informs about success (or failing).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref1"
name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The concerned &quot;actions&quot; are
quite complex procedures, in fact a collection of connected actions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2"
name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> As one may guess, the folder contains
Romania's XML-files (RO.xml and RO_DataConfig.xml). If the backup concerns an
add-on, it still takes the form of a folder called e.g. <i>MTR_2014-01-12_10-57-18</i>, containing the add-ons XML-file (i.e. MTR.xml).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref3"
name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> In fact the backup-folder must
contain the country's (or add-on's) XML-files, but actually it is not
necessary, that the folder was produced by a backup generated via the user
interface.</p>
