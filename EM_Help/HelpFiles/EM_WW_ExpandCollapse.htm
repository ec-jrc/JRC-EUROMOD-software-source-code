<h1>Expanding and collapsing policies and functions</h1>

<p>In order to view all the functions in a policy (or all the
parameters in a function respectively) you can expand the policy/function in
the following ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>by clicking
     the little <i>right arrow</i> button on the
     left side of its name.</li>
 <li>by focusing
     on that policy/function and pressing the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>Ctrl + Right Arrow</i> key combination on your keyboard.</li>
 <li>by focusing
     on that policy/function and pressing the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>plus</i> key on your keyboard (this will also work for multiple
     selected policies/functions).</li>
 <li>by focusing
     on that policy/function and pressing the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>multiply</i> key on your keyboard (this will fully expand the
     focused/selected items and all its children).</li>
 <li>by right-clicking on the policy/function/parameter name and selecting the
     menu item <i>Expand All Functions</i>
     (this will fully expand the focused/selected policies and all its
     children).</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, you can return to the compact view by collapsing
an expanded policy/function in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>by clicking
     the little <i>down arrow</i> button on the
     left side of its name.</li>
 <li>by focusing
     on that policy/function and pressing the <i>Ctrl + Left Arrow</i> key combination on your keyboard (if the
     focused item is already collapsed, this will move the focus to the item's
     parent).</li>
 <li>by focusing on
     that policy/function and pressing the <i>minus</i>
     key on your keyboard (this will also work for multiple selected
     policies/functions).</li>
 <li>by focusing
     on that policy/function and pressing the <i>divide</i> key on your keyboard (this will fully collapse the
     focused/selected items and all its children).</li>
 <li>by right-clicking on the policy/function/parameter name and selecting the
     menu item <i>Collapse All Functions</i>
     (this will fully collapse the focused/selected policies and all its
     children).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, to view all functions and parameters of all
policies (i.e. the whole available information) right click the header of the <i>Policy</i> column and select the menu item <i>Expand All Policies</i>. To return to the
compact view, i.e. hide all functions and parameters, right click the header of
the <i>Policy</i> column and select the menu
item <i>Collapse All Policies</i>.</p>
