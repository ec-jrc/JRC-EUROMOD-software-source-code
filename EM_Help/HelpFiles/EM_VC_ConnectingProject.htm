<h1>Connecting & Disconnecting a project</h1>

<h4>Connecting a project</h4>

<p>To connect your local project to the version control system, click the button <i>Connect</i> in the in the <i>Version
Control</i> ribbon's section <i>NEW ONLINE BUNDLE.</i>.
The <i>Connect</i> button is only available if the project is not yet
connected to version control, as it changes to <i>Disconnect</i> when a connection is already 
established - see below. Furthermore, this button is only enabled if you are already <i><a href="EM_VC_LogInOut.htm">logged in</a></i>.</p>

<p>Clicking on the Connect button will bring up the <i>Connect Project to Version Control</i> form. There you will see a listing of all projects which are available
to you<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> on the version control system. Ticking the respective project and pressing <i>OK</i>
connects the local project (the one loaded by the interface) to the VC project (the version controlled project just selected). This is indicated by an
informative message, while the button <i>Disconnect</i> changes its caption to <i>Connect</i> and the application title bar changes to include the
name of the VC project your local project is connected to. Lastly (but not least), this will enable most other VC buttons (depending on your access rights).</p>

<p>Please note that every time you close EUROMOD, your local project will be automatically disconnected from the VC project.</p>

<h4>Removing the connection</h4>

<p>Once you have finished with any VC-related work you had to do, you can safely disconnect your local project by pressing the button <i>Disconnect</i>. 
This will immediately disconnect your local project from the VC project it was connected to. The success of this action is indicated by an
informative message, while the button <i>Disconnect</i> changes its caption to <i>Connect</i> and the application title bar changes to remove the
name of the VC project your local project was connected to. Lastly (but not least), this will disable most other VC buttons.</p>
