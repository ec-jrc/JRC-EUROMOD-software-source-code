<h1>Exporting & Importing Systems</h1>

<h4>Exporting systems</h4>
<p>To export (a) system(s), select the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and click the button <i>Export System(s)</i>. In the appearing
dialog select the system(s) you want to export and indicate an <i>Export folder</i>. You can use the button beside
the field to open a file search dialog, allowing for selecting a respective
path. If you want to remove the exported systems from the country select <i>Export and delete</i>, if you want to export
the systems without removing them select <i>Export
only</i>. Click <i>OK</i> to start the
procedure.</p>

<p>The export procedure creates a folder named after the
country's short name (e.g. a folder &quot;DK&quot; if systems are exported from
Denmark), which encloses parameter files, which contain the exported systems.
In fact the procedure is very similar to the save-as procedure (see <a
href="EM_WW_Saving.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Saving, saving as and auto-saving</a>), with mainly two differences. Firstly
(and obviously) the not exported systems are removed from the &quot;export
country's&quot; parameter files and, if the option<i> Export and delete</i> was selected, the exported systems are removed
from the origin country's parameter files. Secondly (and less obviously) the
origin country's as well as the export country's parameter files are
&quot;cleaned&quot;. That means all policies, functions or parameters, which
contain only <i>n/a</i>
values for all remaining systems, are removed. To understand this, imagine
having implemented a reform scenario by using many new policies, functions and
parameters. If the reform's system is exported (for later use or storage
purposes) it would leave a lot of garbage in the country's parameter files. If
however all elements only used for the reform are set to <i>n/a</i> in all other systems, the
export procedure cares for their removal.</p>

<p>Note that the export procedure also stores the data
configurations of the exported systems, and, if the option<i> Export and delete</i> was selected, deletes them in the country's
parameter file.</p>

<h4>Importing systems</h4>

<p>To import systems to a country select the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and click the button <i>Import System(s)</i>. In the appearing
dialog first select the folder where the systems are stored by using the folder
button. This could be either a folder created by the export procedure (see
above) or a folder created with the <i>Save
As</i> procedure (see <a href="EM_WW_Saving.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Saving,
saving as and auto-saving</a>) or even another
country's folder. Once an appropriate folder is selected, the systems contained
in the respective parameter files are displayed in the <i>Systems</i> list. Select one or more systems and click <i>OK</i> to start the procedure.</p>

<p>The import procedure has to match the imported system(s)
with the systems already included in the country's parameter file. That means,
in order to present them in the country's spine, it has to add policies,
functions or parameters, which only exist in the imported systems. These
elements are set to <i>n/a</i>
in the existing systems, amongst others, to allow for &quot;tidy&quot; removal
with the export procedure (see above).</p>

<p>Note that the import procedure asks for a name for an
imported system (only) if a system with the same name already exists. Moreover,
if the country of the imported system(s) does not correspond with the import
country, the procedure asks whether the polices should be renamed respectively,
i.e. for example from <i>ILDef_ee</i>
to <i>ILDef_hu</i>,
<i>tin_ee</i> to <i>tin_hu</i>, <i>bsa_ee</i> to <i>bsa_hu</i>, etc. if
an Estonian system is imported to Hungary. This allows aligning the respective
policies side by side.</p>

<p>Note that the import procedure also imports the data
configurations of the imported systems, if it finds respective information in
the import parameter files.</p>

<p>Also note that the import dialog offers a checkbox <i>Match by Unique Identifier</i>. The box is
only enabled when such an import is possible, for which the first (but not
only) condition is, that the systems are imported from another version of the
same country. For further details please consult <a
href="EM_WW_ComparingCountryVersions.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Comparing
versions of a country</a>, paragraph <i>Importing</i><i> systems by
matching unique identifiers</i>.</p>

<p>Finally note that the changes caused by importing or
exporting systems cannot be undone by using the undo functionality. However,
the user interface produces a backup before starting the action, which can be
restored via the button <i>Restore</i> in
the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i>. For more
information see (<a href="EM_WW_BackupRestore.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Backup
- Restore</a>).</p>
