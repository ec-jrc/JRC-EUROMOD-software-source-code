<h1>Copying policies</h1>

<h4>Copying policies within a country</h4>

<p>To copy a policy right click its name for opening the policy
context menu and selecting the menu item <i>Copy
Policy</i>.</p>

<p>To paste the copied policy right click the name of the
policy before or after which you want to insert the copy. From the<i> </i>policy context menu select the menu
item <i>Paste Policy Before</i> to place the
copied policy before the right clicked policy or <i>Paste Policy After</i> to paste the copied policy after the right
clicked policy.</p>

<p>A dialog appears which asks you to indicate the policy's
name, initially suggesting the template's name. Note however that you need to
change this name as there must not be two policies with the same name. Moreover
note the policy naming conventions explained in <a
href="EM_WW_AddingPolicies.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Adding policies</a>.
Clicking <i>OK</i> adds a new policy, which
is initially (except the name) a perfect copy of its template.</p>

<h4>Copying policies from one
country to another</h4>

<p>Copying a policy to another country is in principle not
different to the approach described above, however
after defining the name, a dialog appears which allows the assignment of
systems. To understand this, consider a policy that is copied from a country
with three systems to a country with just one system: which system’s parameter
values should be copied?</p>

<p>The dialog contains a table, which lists the system
assignments, where assignment means that the parameters of the destination
system are to be filled with the values of the source system. The left part of
each row shows a system of the destination country and the right part indicates
the assigned system of the source country. If the destination country’s system
is not assigned to any system of the source country, the right part of the
table shows &quot;Not Assigned&quot;. To choose another system of the source
country, just click the respective cell, which opens a dialog that allows
selecting the system. Select no system for no
assignment.</p>

<p>Clicking the button <i>Clear
Assignment</i> removes all assignments between destination and source systems,
thus the table shows &quot;Not Assigned&quot; for all destination systems. Note
that, when it is first opened, the dialog shows a default assignment, which
tries to match systems of the same policy year, e.g. UK_2010 with BE_2010,
UK_2012 with BE_2012, etc.</p>

<p>Clicking <i>OK</i> adds
the policy as specified. If a system is not assigned, parameter values are set
to <i>n/a</i>.</p>

<h4>Copying policies as a reference</h4>

<p>The policy context menu also offers the menu items <i>Paste Reference Before</i> respectively <i>Paste Reference After</i>. The case is as
follows: it may be necessary, that a policy<i>
</i>is calculated twice in the model run. For example, social insurance
contributions may need to be calculated before income tax, as they are needed
as an input, however income tax may as well be needed as an input for social
insurance contribution calculations. A usual approach to solve such a problem
of circularity is to calculate contributions twice, before and after income tax
calculations. As the order of policies in the spine determines the processing
sequence of policies (see <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">EUROMOD Basic
Concepts - Presentation of countries' tax-benefit systems</a> and <a
href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - Terminology</a> for more
information on the EUROMOD spine and the order of policies) it would be
necessary to insert the policy calculating social insurance contributions
twice. Such a redundancy is however error prone as changes need
to be implemented in both policies, which is easy to forget. A reference avoids
this problem by being just an entry in the spine with the same name as the
respective policy but with the twin symbol to denote it as a reference. The reference
is just information for the rerun of a policy and does not display any
functions - to view its definitions one has to refer to the &quot;real&quot;
policy.</p>

<p>Technically inserting a reference works just like copying a
policy, with the difference that the menu items <i>Paste Reference </i>are selected instead of <i>Paste Policy</i>. For obvious reasons it is not possible to copy a
policy in one country and paste it to another country.</p>
