<h1>Administrate Content</h1>

<p>Pressing the button <i>Administrate Content</i> in the <i>Version Control</i>
ribbon's section <i>NEW VC PROJECT</i> opens a dialog which displays all the units that are 
common between the VC project and the local project. This dialog allows for three operations:</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Adding Local Units to the VC project</li>
	<li>Downloading units of the VC project locally</li>
	<li>Removing units from the VC project</li>
</ol>

<h4>Add Local Units to VC</h4>
<p>
Pressing this button lists units which <i><strong>exist locally</strong></i>, but <i><strong>do not 
exist in the VC project</strong></i>. The essential purpose of this operation is making a unit 
(existing in the loaded project) version controlled. By selecting the respective units from the 
list and pressing OK, the units will be &quot;made version controlled&quot;, which, expressed more precisely,
comprises two operations: Firstly, the local version of the unit is uploaded to
VC and thus forms the first (remote) version of the unit. Secondly, the local
and the (new) remote version are linked.</p>

<p>
A new version of the project will be created if new units are added to VC. You can change the version number by clicking on Manual Version
and writing the version.</p>

<h4>Get Units from VC</h4>
<p>Pressing this button lists units which <i><strong>do not exist locally</strong></i>, however <i><strong>
they exist in the VC project</strong></i>. The essential purpose of this operation is to download a unit from 
the remote VC project and include it in your local project. By selecting the respective units from the list 
and pressing OK, the most recent version of the units will be &quot;downloaded&quot; and added to your local
project.</p>

<h4>Remove Units from VC</h4>
<p>Pressing this button lists units which <i><strong>exist both locally and on the VC project</strong></i>. 
The essential purpose of this operation is to remove units from the VC project. 
By selecting the respective units from the list and pressing OK, the units are
removed from the VC project. 

</p> A new version of the project will be created if new units are added to VC. You can change the version number by clicking on Manual Version
and writing the version.</p>
