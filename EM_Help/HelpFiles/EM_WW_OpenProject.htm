<h1>Open a EUROMOD project</h1>

<p>The item <i>Open Project</i>
of the main menu<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title="">[1]</a>
opens a dialog which allows for switching the EUROMOD project to which the user
interface refers to. For a description of what a EUROMOD project is see <a
href="EM_WW_AdminProjects.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD
projects</a>.</p>

<p>The dialog offers two ways to select the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a project that was opened by the user
interface before</li>

<li>Selecting a project that was not yet opened by
the user interface, but is stored on the user's disk<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Selecting a project that was opened before</h4>
<p>For this purpose, select the respective project from
the list of available projects displayed by the combo-box <i>Project Folder</i>.
Note that the user interface &quot;knows&quot; about the available (i.e. at
least once opened) projects, because it stores &quot;user settings&quot; (in
fact project settings) for each of them. These user settings contain amongst others
the project's path.</p>

<h4>Selecting a project that was not yet opened</h4>
<p>For this purpose, click the button alongside the field
<i>Project Folder</i> and select the
respective path with the help of the opened file-dialog. If you know it by
heart you can also type the project's path.<br>
Note that the selected folder must contain the EUROMOD file structure (see <a
href="EM_FS_FileStructure.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
content (parameter files)</a>).</p>

<h4>Opening the user interface for the very first time</h4>
<p>There is in fact an alternative instance when a user becomes to see the
open-project-dialog than via the menu-item <i>Open
Project</i>. That is, when the EUROMOD user interface is opened for the very
first time.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title="">[3]</a> In
this case the dialog shows an additional button <i>New ...</i>, which allows for opening the new-project-dialog (see <a
href="EM_WW_NewProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - New project</a>) and thus,
instead of opening an existing project, generating a new one.

... or if the user-settings (i.e. the information that
is stored internally about the user's personal specifications) are invalid. The
most likely reason for invalid user-settings is that they refer to a project
folder that does not exist (any more) or does not contain the EUROMOD file
structure.</p>
