<h1>Presentation of countries' tax-benefit-systems</h1>

<h4>Loading countries</h4>

<p>Clicking a flag in the user interface's <i>Countries</i> ribbon opens EUROMOD's representation of the respective
country's tax-benefit system. The country’s name and flag is shown right of the
<i>Run EUROMOD</i> button, to indicate which
country is loaded. Further countries can be loaded by clicking their flags.
Each country is represented in its own window and one can switch between these
windows by again clicking the respective flag or via the Windows taskbar.</p>

<h4>The EUROMOD spine</h4>

<p>The main part of the window displays the representation of
the country's tax-benefit system - at the time of opening in a collapsed state.
Thus it shows what in EUROMOD lingo is frequently referred to as the <i>spine</i>. The EUROMOD spine is the list of <i>policies</i> worked off in sequence when the
model performs its calculations. The term <i>policies</i>
refers as well to policies in a narrow sense, i.e. benefits and taxes, as to
special EUROMOD policies. These special policies for example define which
variables are contained in the output. See <a href="#TM_SpecialEuromodPolicies">Special
EUROMOD policies</a> below for further information. Each row of the spine
represents one policy.</p>

<h4>EUROMOD policies, functions and parameters</h4>

<p>Expanding a policy by clicking the little <i>plus </i>button left of the policy's
name allows viewing the implementation of the policy. A policy is implemented
by so-called <i>functions</i>. Each EUROMOD
function is a self-contained building block that has its own parameters and represents
a particular component of the respective policy. A typical social assistance
benefit may for example be implemented by a function that determines
eligibility for the benefit and a function that calculates the benefit amount
for all eligible units. In fact these two functions: a function that determines
eligibility/liability for benefits/taxes in a very general way and a function
that calculates a wide range of benefits/taxes are the two most frequently used
functions in EUROMOD. The purpose of using functions as building blocks of the
model is to provide a general structure, which can be seen as using a
standardised language to describe policy instruments. Once EUROMOD users are
accustomed to this language, their understanding of other (foreign) countries'
benefits and taxes, and how they are implemented in EUROMOD, improves
considerably. The parameters of a function can be viewed by expanding it using
the little <i>plus </i>button left of its
name. The section <a href="EM_FC_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Functions</a> gives a
detailed description of EUROMOD functions, including their use, the specific
behaviour and the parameters they provide to guide this behaviour. Expanded
policies and functions can be re-collapsed by the little <i>minus</i> buttons. Note that the policy and function worked on is
displayed in the status bar.</p>

<h4>EUROMOD systems</h4>

<p>The changes of a country's tax-benefit system over time are
captured by EUROMOD <i>systems</i>. A
EUROMOD system either reflects the tax-benefit rules for a specific policy year
(assuming annual adaptations of tax-benefit rules) or the rules for an actual
(planned) or imaginary reform scenario. The columns of the country's view
represent these EUROMOD systems. Thus the value of a specific parameter (e.g.
the rate of a particular tax band) for specific systems is defined at the
intersection points of the parameter's row and the respective systems' columns
(e.g. may take the value of 10% for the 2009-system and the value of 11% for
the 2010-system).</p>

<p>The fact that policy reforms are not always as simple as
changing the value of a specific parameter is taken into account by so called <i>switches</i>. The intersection points of
policies and functions with the systems represent these <i>switches</i>, i.e. they allow to switch policies and functions on or
off dependent on the system. The <i>switches</i>
also provide the settings <i>n/a</i>,
standing for not applicable, and <i>toggle</i>,
standing for temporarily switched off. More detailed explanations of these
settings can be found in the section <a href="EM_FC_CommonParameters.htm">EUROMOD
Functions - Common Parameters</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="TM_SpecialEuromodPolicies"></a>Special EUROMOD policies</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, the EUROMOD spine comprises policies,
which do not describe e.g. a tax or benefit. Instead they implement
definitions, which are necessary for the model's calculation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The policy <strong><i>ILDef_cc</i></strong> contains
definitions of so called <i>incomelists</i>.
Technically an incomelist is the aggregate of several variables, which are
added or subtracted to build the aggregate. The term &quot;income&quot;list
indicates that the most common applications of this (important EUROMOD) concept
are income definitions, for example disposable income, taxable income, etc.</li>

<li>The policy <strong><i>TUDef_cc</i></strong> contains
definitions of assessment units, which are in EUROMOD sometimes referred to as <i>tax units</i> (and are another important
EUROMOD concept). Many taxes and especially benefits do not concern single
individuals, but refer to bigger units, for example some sort of family
definition. Assessment units allow for such definitions by specifying who
belongs to the unit, who is a child, etc.</li>

<li>Datasets are usually used for
implementing several systems, by up-dating monetary values to the corresponding
year. The policy <strong><i>Uprate_cc</i></strong> contains such up-dating of monetary dataset
variables.</li>

<li>The policies <strong><i>output_std_cc</i></strong> and <strong><i>output_std_hh_cc</i></strong>
contain the specification of standard output on individual and household level
(see section <a href="EM_BC_InOut.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - EUROMOD input
and output</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The listed policies are standard, that means they are
implemented for each country contained in EUROMOD. Some countries contain
further special policies like for example <i>ConstDef_cc</i>,
which defines basic values, which are used all over the implementation, e.g.
minimum income amount, pension age, etc.</p>

<p>Technically there is no difference between special policies
and standard policies, both use functions for their implementation and both
need to be listed in the spine to be performed. Thus calling them special is
just a matter of better comprehensibility. Moreover, the functions, which are in
principle dedicated for the implementation of a special policy, like the
function<i> DefIL </i>for the policy<i> ILDef_cc</i>, can be used in any other
policy as well, if this seems appropriate.</p>
