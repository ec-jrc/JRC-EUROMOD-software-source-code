<h1>Remove Bundles</h1>

<p>From time to time you may find yourself in a situation (e.g. due to a human error) 
where you need to remove an already committed bundle. Assuming that you are already 
logged in, connected to a project, you can do 
this by clicking the <i>Remove Bundle</i> button in the Version Control ribbon's section <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i> to bring up the 
<i>Version Control - Remove Bundles</i> form.</p>

<p>The <i>Version Control - Remove Bundles</i> form displays a list with detailed
information on all available bundles of this VC project. This list includes the exact
date and time each bundle was generated, the version name and the username of the <i>Author</i> of this
particular bundle. Each bundle also has a checkbox on the left, allowing to select them.</p>

<p>Once you have selected the bundle(s) you want to remove, you can do so by clicking the
<i>Remove Bundle(s)</i> button on the right.
