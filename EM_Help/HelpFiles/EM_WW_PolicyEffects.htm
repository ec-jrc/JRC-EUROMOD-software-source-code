<h1>Policy
Effects tool</h1>

<h4>What is the Policy Effects
tool?</h4>

<p>The Policy Effects tool estimates the first-order effects of
policies on household incomes. The tool is meant to assist with model
validation (see EUROMOD Country Reports on the EUROMOD website) and compares
policies in place in two consecutive years, both in nominal and real terms.</p>

<h4>Where can I find this?</h4>

<p>You can find the Policy Effects tool under the
&quot;Applications&quot; toolbar ribbon, inside the &quot;Tools&quot; group.</p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

<p>When you open the Policy Effects tool you are presented with
an input form, which allows you to specify the (start) period of interest,
countries, input datasets and indexation factors (<i>alphas</i>, see Methodology below). By default, the tool is set to
analyse policy changes in the most recent policy year available in the model,
using the dataset offering the best match for the start of this period (see <a
href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - Terminology</a>).</p>

<p>The field <i>Output path</i>
at the bottom of the form allows changing the default output folder where the
tool stores micro-level output for relevant policy scenarios together with log
files (standard EUROMOD run logs and a tool-specific log). Note that the output
folder must exist, otherwise EUROMOD issues an error message, and any existing
files with the same names will be overwritten without a warning. </p>

<p>To produce micro-output and summary results, click on the
&quot;Run &amp; Show Results&quot; button. </p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Once specified policy systems have been simulated and
analysed, you will be presented with the results form. This has a tab control
(on the bottom) with a separate tab for each country previously selected. Each
country tab page has one inner tab control (on the top), with a separate tab
for each selected indexation factor (<i>alpha</i>).</p>

<p>Each summary table shows the effect of policy changes in a
given period on mean equivalised household disposable
income by (standard) income component and income decile group, as a percentage
of mean equivalised household disposable income in
the starting year. The latter is also used to construct income decile groups.
Throughout, the modified OECD equivalence scale is used. For example, a 3
percentage point change for public pensions in the third decile group in
country A, indicates that changes (increases) in
public pensions accounted for a 3 percentage point increase in average equivalised household income. In the case of taxes and SIC,
a positive (negative) number implies that taxes/SIC have been reduced
(increased). The sum of effects by income component (columns 2 to 8) equals the
total (column 9).</p>

<p>You can copy-paste any selected cells from these tables,
either by pressing Ctrl+C or by right-clicking and
selecting &quot;Copy&quot; from the context menu. You can also export all the
calculated statistics (all tables for all countries) into a single Excel file,
by clicking on the &quot;Export&quot; button.</p>

<h4>Methodology</h4>

<p>The estimation of policy changes draws on the method
suggested by Bargain and Callan (2010, The Journal of Economic Inequality).
Consider a single household and denote its market income (and other
characteristics) with <i>y</i> and monetary
values of tax-benefit parameters as <i>p</i>.
A function <i>d(</i><i>p,y</i><i>)</i> calculates household disposable income
on the basis of its market income and monetary parameters, reflecting the
structure of the tax-benefit system (e.g. tax rates, benefit eligibility
rules). In period <i>t</i>, household
disposable income can be denoted as <i>d<sub>t</sub>(p<sub>t</sub>,y<sub>t</sub>)</i>.</p>

<p>The tool estimates the <u>direct</u> effect of policy
changes on household incomes in the period from <i>t=1 </i>to <i>t=2</i>. To isolate it from other changes in
the income distribution (e.g. changes in household composition or market
incomes), household disposable incomes under the two policy systems are
assessed holding household characteristics and market incomes <u>constant</u>.
Furthermore, to adjust for changes in nominal income levels over time, the
monetary parameters of the tax-benefit system are adjusted with a factor <i>alpha</i> which reflects benchmark
indexation. Specifically, the tool estimates the policy effect (for each
household) as: </p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=208 height=44 id="_x0000_i1026"

<p>Note that this is a particular variation of decomposition
chosen for EUROMOD validation purposes. (The full decomposition framework is
described in BC2010.) Technically, instead of scaling monetary policy parameters,
the tool scales monetary input variables with the factor <i>alpha</i> and monetary output variables with the factor <i>1/alpha:</i></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=213 height=43 id="_x0000_i1025"
src="files/policy_effects_2.png"></p>

<p>This relies on the assumption that tax-benefit systems are
linearly homogenous, that is <i>d(</i><i>cp,cy</i><i>)=cd(p,y)</i>. Input
variable adjustments are limited to market incomes, expenditures and assets
(specifically: all monetary variables which name starts with <i>y*</i> or <i>x*</i>, variable <i>afc</i>
as well as all variables included in <i>ils_origy</i>, while excluding variables included in <i>ils_ben</i>). Output
variable adjustments cover all monetary variables. </p>

<p>Summary results in the table are shown as a percentage of
(mean) disposable incomes in the starting year, i.e. <i>d<sub>1</sub>(p<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)</i>.</p>

<p>There are two pre-defined choices for benchmark indexation:
(i) factor <i>alpha</i>
could be set to 1 in which case the effect of policy changes is calculated
simply in nominal terms, or (ii) CPI indexation in which case the effect of
policy changes is calculated in real terms. For (ii), the adjustment factor is
automatically derived on the basis of Eurostat’s Harmonized Index of Consumer
Prices – this information needs to be defined (as <i>$HICP</i>) along with other series of uprating indices (in the index
table). </p>

<p><strong>Note that the tool <u>cannot</u>
be used when uprating factors are not defined in an index table</strong> (see <a
href="EM_WW_DefiningUpratingFactors.htm">Defining Uprating Factors</a>).</p>
