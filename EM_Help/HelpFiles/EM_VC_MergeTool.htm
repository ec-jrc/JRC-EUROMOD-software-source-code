<h1>The Merge Tool</h1>

<p>The user interface provides a tool that supports the merging
of two versions of a country or add-on. Imagine developer A and developer B
both have worked on country X. The tool firstly allows viewing what was changed
between the two versions. Secondly, the tool offers facilities to determine which 
changes are to be overtaken in the final merged version.</p>

<p>Please note that the following description, for simplicity
reasons, refers to countries only though all descriptions apply for add-ons as
well.</p>

<h4>Selecting the versions</h4>

<p>Clicking the button <i>Merge Country</i> (in the <i> NEW ONLINE BUNDLE </i> section) or
<i> Compare & merge country</i> (in the <i>ADVANCED OPTION</i> section)in the VC ribbon opens a dialog which 
allows defining the versions which are to be compared and merged,
whereupon one of the versions is always the country, which is currently loaded
by the user interface and from which the dialog was started. This version is
referred to as the <strong><i>Local Version</i></strong>.</p>

<p>Consequently, the dialog allows for loading a <strong><i>Remote
Version</i></strong>, which is the country folder containing the version (i.e.
XML-files) that should be compared and merged with the <i>Local
Version</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, a <strong><i>Parent Version</i></strong> can be selected from the <i>Advanced options</i>. This
is the version from which as well the local as the remote version started from,
i.e. ideally the base where the two versions diverged. This parent version is
used by the interface (solely) to decide whether a change occurred in the local
version or in the remote version.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

<p>Taking into account, that a parent version may not always be
available, the dialog allows that either the local (by checking the box <i>Use Local</i>) or the remote version (by
checking the box <i>Use Remote</i>) may be
defined as the parent version, meaning that all changes are considered as
remote respectively local. By default (without selecting any parent version from the advanced options), the local version
 will be defined as parent version.</p>



<p>Clicking <i>OK</i> performs
the comparison, which, depending on the extent of differences, may take a
while, and opens the <i>merge dialog</i>.</p>

<h4>The merge dialog</h4>

<p>The merge dialog is split up into three areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The (small) upper part displays changes in the country settings (see <i>Representation of changes in country settings</i>)</li>

	<li>The (big) middle part displays all other changes (see <i>Representation of changes</i>)</li>

	<li>The (small) lower part comprises three buttons, which allow for performing the merge (see <i>Performing
	the merge - button Apply</i>) or interrupting one's work by optionally saving the so far taken definitions (see <i>Interrupting
	one's work - buttons Save and</i> <i>Close</i>).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Representation of changes</h5>

<p>The middle and main part of the merge dialog comprises a
register with the following four tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Systems</i>: This tab lists added and deleted systems as well as changes in system settings.</li>

	<li><i>Policy</i>-Spine:
	Is the main tab and displays all changes in the policy spine, i.e. added and
	deleted policies, functions and parameters; changes in policy/function-switches
	and parameter values; other changes in policies, functions and parameters, like
	e.g. changed name, comment, etc.</li>

	<li><i>Data</i>:
	This tab lists added and deleted datasets as well as changes in dataset settings.
	In addition, it shows changes in the systems which can be used with the
	datasets. Moreover, it lists changes in the settings of policy-switches.</li>

	<li><i>Conditional Formatting</i>: This tab lists changes in conditional formatting settings.</li>
<li><i>Uprating indices</i>: This tab lists changes in uprating indices.</li>
<li><i>Extensions</i>: This tab lists changes in extensions.</li>
<li><i>Switches</i>: This tab lists changes in switches.</li>
<li><i>Groups</i>: This tab lists changes in groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure of the eight tabs is very similar and will be
described by means of the main tab, the <i>Policy-Spine</i>
tab.</p>

<p>The main part of each tab is taken by two &quot;lists&quot;
(with tree-structure, to allow for collapsing and expanding the information),
where the left one presents the local spine, whereas the right one presents the
remote spine. The two lists are synchronised so that one can see local and
remote spine side-by-side. That means, amongst others, that expanding or
scrolling in one of the two lists always effects in the same move of the other
list. Initially the two spines are an extract of the two spines, in the sense
that only those parts of the spine are displayed which contain changes. Please
note that, given the tree-structure of the list, this means that if e.g. a parameter
is changed the parent-function and parent-policy is visible too. However, the
sibling-parameters are not displayed, neither the &quot;aunt&quot;-functions
(unless they show changes as well). This initial view can be further reduced by
filtering changes, as described below, or extended to the full spine by
pressing the button <i>Release Filter</i>.</p>

<p>The bottom part of the tab fulfils two tasks: The
left-bottom-part allows for filtering the changes. That means it provides
options to show only certain types of changes. As an example, one may want to
see only added and removed policies, but not anything else (i.e. added/deleted
functions/parameters should be not displayed, neither changes in values
switches or other settings of policies, functions and parameters).</p>

<p>The right-bottom-part allows for accepting and rejecting
changes, i.e. determining which changes are to be overtaken into the merged
version. For more information see <i>Defining
the carrying out of the merge</i> below.</p>

<h6>Types and representation of changes</h6>

<p>In principle, there are three types of changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Additions</strong> (of policies, functions and parameters) are displayed by a green plus at the left edge of the spine.</li>

	<li>Accordingly, <strong>removals</strong> are displayed by a red minus.</li>

	<li><strong>Changes</strong> are marked by a pencil. Note that changes may concern parameter-<i><strong>values</strong></i>
	or policy/function-<i><strong>switches</strong></i>, as well as
	parameter/function/policy-<i><strong>settings</strong></i> (like e.g. comments,
	private-settings, etc.). Accordingly, each policy, function and parameter is
	accompanied by columns containing these <i><strong>settings</strong></i>, as well as the <i><strong>value/switch</strong></i>-settings per
	system. This means that a &quot;change&quot; (display of a pencil) in e.g. a
	policy may mean that the policy switch is changed in one or more systems and/or
	that any policy-setting, like e.g. its name, is changed. Which of these
	settings is changed is represented by highlighting the respective cell with
	either red or green colour (the meaning of red and green will be explained in
	the paragraph after the next).</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether a change is local or remote is represented by
showing the plus/minus/pencil and the highlighting in either the (left) local
tree or the (right) remote tree. Note that for added components the respective
other tree shows an empty row (as the component does not exist in this
version). For deleted components, the concerned tree shows the name (for better
understanding), while the other tree (where the component still exists) shows
the full information.</p>

<p>Alongside each change-symbol (plus/minus/pencil) there is
another symbol, which indicates whether the change is accepted or rejected,
i.e. should go into the merged version or not. Accepted changes are accompanied
by a green hook, whereas rejected changes are accompanied by a red cross.
Moreover, there is a third symbol, an arrow pointing to the right. This symbol
may show up if e.g. a policy has several changes, i.e. the name and the comment
is changed, and/or the switch is changed in more than one system. The arrow is
displayed if these changes are partly accepted and partly rejected. Whether the changes 
are accepted or rejected, is represented by the colour of
the highlighting. Green highlighting marks an accepted change, while red
highlighting marks a rejected change.</p>

<h6>Special display of order-changes</h6>

<p>Given the fact that the local and the remote spine are synchronised,
in the sense that &quot;twin&quot;-polices, functions and parameters are
displayed side-by-side, the order of the spine is not necessarily correctly
displayed, as it may differ between local and remote version.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p>For watching the real order, and possibly assess differences
in the order of the local and the remote spine, a special column can be shown.
This is accomplished by clicking the button <i>Show
Order</i>. The column shows entries like <i>LR:7</i> or <i>L:7/R:8</i>,
where the former, if displayed with a function, means, that the function is in
both spines the 7th within its parent-policy. The latter means,
that the function is the 7th in the <i>L</i>ocal
spine whereas it is the 8th in the <i>R</i>emote
spine.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;parallelism&quot; is not affected by new or
removed components. For example orders like local <i>PolA-PolB-PolC-PolD</i> and remote <i>PolA-PolB-<strong>newPolBC-PolC-PolD</strong></i> would be numbered as
<i>PolA</i><i>(LR:1)-PolB(LR:2)-<strong>newPolBC</strong>(L:R:3)-PolC(LR:4)-PolD(LR:5).</i></p>

<p>Also note that for a full view of the order you may want to
show the full spine by clicking the button <i>Release
Filter</i>.</p>

<p>As it would however be rather cumbersome to watch out for
order changes in the order-column, policies and functions where the function-
respectively parameter-order differs in local and remote spine are marked by a
highlighted (green or red) button at the very left edge of the local spine.
Differences in the order of policies are indicated by a highlighted button at
the very left of the heading-row of the local spine.</p>

<h6>Filtering changes</h6>

<p>The merge tool offers, in the left-bottom part of the
dialog, several options to hide and show different types of changes, with the
intent to provide the user with a better overview.</p>

<p><i>Remote / Local:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Local and
	Remote</i>: With this option checked as well local as remote changes are
	displayed.</li>

	<li><i>Local only</i>:
	With this option checked only local changes are displayed. For a better
	understanding note that the displays of the local and remote spine are still
	synchronised, i.e. show the same policies, functions and parameters. However,
	if for example a function is changed in the remote version, but not in the
	local version, this function will not be visible (neither in the local nor in
	the remote spine).</li>

	<li><i>Remote
	only</i>: With this option checked only remote changes are displayed, in the
	same sense as described above for <i>Local
	only</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Type:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Added</i>:
	Checking this option effects that added policies,
	functions and parameters are displayed (unless they are out-ruled by a <i>Level</i>- or <i>Remote/Local</i>-filter), while unchecking the option means that added
	policies are not displayed.</li>

	<li><i>Removed</i>:
	Checking/unchecking this option effects the same for
	removed components as described above for added components.</li>

	<li><i>Reordered</i>:
	Checking/unchecking this option effects the same for policies and function with
	different function- respectively parameter-order in the two spines as described
	above for added components.</li>

	<li><i>Changed</i>:
	In principle checking/unchecking this option effects
	the same for changed components as described above for added components.
	However, the filter can be further refined by showing only selected types of
	changes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><i>All
		Settings / Selected Settings</i>: If the option <i>All Settings</i> is checked, all components with changes in any setting
		(name, comment, private, ...) are shown. This can
		however be restricted to, e.g. only show components where the comment is
		changed, by unchecking <i>All Settings</i>
		and therewith enable the check-boxes alongside the single settings. The task is
		accomplished by unchecking all single-settings except the <i>Comment</i>-setting (and perhaps the <i>Name</i>-setting for a better overview).</li>

		<li><i>All Values
		/ Selected Values</i>: This option works in the same manner for
		parameter-values and policy/function-switches per system as described above for
		<i>Settings</i>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>


<p><i>Level:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Parameter</i>:
Selecting this option corresponds in fact to no <i>Level</i>-filter.</li>

<li><i>Function</i>:
Selecting this option effects that only changes on policy- and function level
are displayed, i.e. parameter-level changes are hidden.</li>

<li><i>Policy</i>:
Selecting this option effects that only changes on policy-level are displayed,
i.e. function- and parameter-level changes are hidden.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the filters only take effect once the
button <i>Apply / Update Filter</i> is
clicked.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the button <i>Release Filter</i> effects the display of the
full spine, i.e. suspends all filters.</p>

<h5>Defining the carrying out of the merge</h5>

<p>Initially the merge tool suggests accepting all changes,
i.e. overtake them into the merged version. This is reflected by green hooks
and green highlighting. Only if there is a conflict, i.e. a component was
changed in the local version as well as in the remote version, the local
version is preferred, i.e. the remote version shows a red cross (or left-arrow)
and possibly a red highlighting. This default setting can be changed in several
ways.</p>

<h6>Accepting / rejecting all changes</h6>

<p>In the left-bottom part of the dialog the merge tool offers
the buttons <i>Accept All</i> and <i>Reject All</i> to accept respectively reject
all changes. For technical reasons (in context with conflict cases)
accepting/rejecting all changes can be only done for one version at once. In
other words, if one wants to accept <i>all</i>,
i.e. local <i>and</i> remote, changes, one
needs to firstly activate the option <i>Local</i>,
then click the respective button, to repeat the same by activating the option <i>Remote</i>.</p>

<p>Still what &quot;all&quot; effectively means depends on the
option <i>Visible Only</i>. If the option is not activated
&quot;all&quot; actually means all. However, if the option is activated,
filters are taken into account, which is described under <i>Effectiveness of filters</i> below.</p>

<p>Accepting all (local or remote) changes may lead to conflicts,
where the tool needs the user's decision on what to do. For example, if all
remote changes are to be accepted and a policy's comment was changed in the
local version as well as in the remote version (i.e. both differ from the
parent version), and the respective local change is currently set to being
accepted, there is a conflict that cannot be solved by the tool without further
information. For such cases, the handling is determined by the options under <i>Conflicts -Prefer ...</i>. If the option <i>Local</i> is selected, the tool will
automatically keep the acceptance of the local change and not set the remote
change to accept. If the option <i>Remote</i>
is selected, the tool will set the remote change to accept and automatically
reject the local change. If the option <i>Warn</i>
is selected, the tool issues a warning for each conflict that it is about to
act as if the option <i>Remote</i> (in case
of <i>Accept All</i> remote changes) was
selected and allows the user to refuse this doing.</p>

<h6>Effectiveness of filters</h6>

<p>If the option <i>Visible Only</i> is activated, filters are taken into account. For
example, assume that the option <i>Added</i>
is activated only, while the check-boxes for <i>Removed</i>, <i>Reordered</i> and <i>Changed</i> are not ticked. In this case the
list of changes would only show added components. Respectively clicking for
example <i>Accept All</i> will only accept
the addition of components, but not the removal, change or reordering. Note
however, that no definition set before the clicking of the button will be
reset, i.e. an already accepted removal would not be changed to rejected.</p>

<p>For clarification, it should also be mentioned that
&quot;visible&quot; refers to filters and not to actual visibility. That means
missing visibility due to collapsing has no effect.</p>

<h6>Accepting / rejecting single changes</h6>

<p>Accepting and rejecting of changes can also be fine-tuned to
single policies, functions and parameters and even to single settings,
parameter-values and policy/function-switches. For this purpose, the merge tool
provides context menus.</p>

<p>Right-clicking the change-symbols (plus/minus/pencil or
hook/cross) left of the changed component opens a context menu with the options
<i>Accept Changes</i>, <i>Reject Changes</i> and a check-box <i>Visible
Only</i>. The logic behind this is the same as described under <i>Accepting / rejecting all changes</i>, just
that the reference is the respective policy, function or parameter (i.e. all
changed values/switches and settings) instead of <i>all</i>.</p>

<p>Right-clicking the cell of a single change, e.g. the change
of the value of a parameter within a certain system, offers the same context
menu, except that the option <i>Visible Only</i> is not available as it does not make sense. Again,
the logic behind this is the same as described above, just that the reference
in this case is the single change instead of all changes of the parameter's
values and settings.</p>

<p>A very similar context menu is offered by right-clicking an
&quot;order change&quot;, i.e. one of the highlighted buttons at the very left
edge of the local tree. In this case the context menu offers the options <i>Accept Order</i>, <i>Reject Order</i> and a check-box <i>Include
Sub-Nodes</i>. Selecting <i>Accept Order</i>
means that the local order is to be taken as the relevant for the merged
version. Selecting <i>Reject Order</i> means
that the local order is rejected and thus that the remote order is taken as the
relevant for the merged version. Ticking the check-box <i>Include Sub-Nodes</i> effects that the relevant order for
&quot;children&quot; (functions and parameters in the case of policies;
parameters in the case of functions) is the same as that for the
&quot;parent&quot;. This means selecting an order for the button concerning the
spine (the button alongside the column-headers) implies selecting an order for
all policies, functions and parameters of the merged version.</p>

<h5>Representation of changes in country settings</h5>

<p>The upper part of the merge dialog displays the
country-settings of the local (on the left side) and the remote version (right
of it). Concretely it shows the name of the country (e.g. Austria, Hungary, Romania) and whether the country is &quot;private&quot; or
not. If these settings are different in the local and the remote version, the
changed-symbol (pencil) is displayed alongside the setting, together with
either the accept-symbol (green hook) or the reject-symbol (red
cross). Clicking this symbol opens a context menu with the options <i>Accept</i> and <i>Reject</i>.</p>

<h5>Interrupting one's work - buttons Save and Close</h5>

<p>If there are many differences between the local and the
remote version it may take quite some consideration to decide what should go
into the finally merged version. Therefore, the merge tool provides a <i>Save</i> button for saving all the so far
taken decisions on accepting and rejecting changes. The merge tool and even the
whole interface can then be closed without loss of the so far accomplished
work. Upon the next time the merge tool is opened for the respective country,
the user interface asks whether the &quot;in-progress merging&quot; should be
used or not.</p>

<p>Note that opening the merge tool with a saved version also
reduces the loading time as the comparison of the local and the remote version
does not have to be repeated.</p>

<p>Also note that the question whether an &quot;in-progress
merging&quot; is to be used is even asked if the merge tool is closed by the <i>Close</i> button, i.e. accepting/rejecting
changes is not saved. The user interface then refers to the copies of the
local-, remote- and parent-version of the country it made at the first opening
of the merge tool (in a sub-folder of the country folder, called <i>Merge</i>). In this case the comparison of
versions has to be repeated and loading is not accelerated.</p>

<p>As however these copies in the <i>Merge</i> folder are at risk to being outdated in the sense that the
local version diverges from the actual country version, the interface performs
a respective comparison and, if necessary, warns that &quot;the info is possibly
not up-to-date&quot;.</p>

<h5>Performing the merge - button Apply</h5>

<p>Pressing the <i>Apply</i>
button will perform the merge by taking the decisions on accepting or rejecting
changes into account. Once accomplished the user interface shows this merged
version. All intermediate info (concretely the <i>Merge</i> folder within the country folder) is deleted.</p>

<p>Please note that the tool may show the info that &quot;...
the local XML-files used for merging are possibly not up-to-date&quot;. This
happens if the country was changed while merging was in progress (see <i>Interrupting one's work - buttons Save and
Close</i>). It is up to the user to decide whether she still wants to perform
the merge.</p>

<p>Finally note that the changes caused by the merge cannot be
undone by using the undo functionality. However, the user interface produces a
backup before starting the action, which can be restored via the button <i>Restore</i> in the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i>. For more information see
(<a href="EM_WW_BackupRestore.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Backup - Restore</a>).</p>

<hr align=left size=1 width="33%">

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Technically that means that, for a
beginning, local and remote version are directly
compared. A difference between the two is then considered as local change, if
remote and parent version match and as remote change, if local and parent
version match. If both, local and remote version, diverge from parent version,
the change is classified as a &quot;conflict&quot;.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> In fact the order may not reflect the
real one for both spines, as for simplicity reasons it follows the location in
the XML-file, which is arbitrary and especially for new components frequently
different from the real order.</p>
