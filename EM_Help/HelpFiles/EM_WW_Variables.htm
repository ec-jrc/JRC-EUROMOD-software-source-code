<h1>Administration
of EUROMOD variables</h1>

<h4>EUROMOD
variables in a nutshell</h4>

<p>All countries implemented in EUROMOD use the same set of
variables to store information taken from input data as well as generated by
the model. For example, a variable called <i>yem</i> is used by each county to
store employment income (taken from input data). As another example, a variable
called <i>bch_s</i>
stores child benefits calculated by the model. This approach does not only care
for high comparability over countries but also supports exchangeability in
facilitating task like, for example, taking some policy measure from one
country and implementing it in another.</p>

<p>At first view the names of EUROMOD variables may seem rather
none intuitive (e.g. <i>dag</i> for age). In
fact, the names follow an elaborated naming scheme, which is described in
detail in the Data Requirement Document (DRD). This brief description confines
itself to mentioning some features, which are useful in identifying the meaning
of a variable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Variables generated by the model end with _s for simulated, whereas variables taken from input data
do not have such an ending. For example bch is a
child benefit taken from data, whereas bch_s
is a simulated child benefit.</li>

<li>The first character of a variable’s name
indicates its type, where <strong>b</strong> stands for <strong>benefit</strong> (e.g. bch: b=benefit, ch=child), <strong>t</strong>
stands for <strong>tax</strong> (e.g. tin: t=tax, in=income), <strong>p</strong> stands for <strong>pension</strong>
(e.g. poa: p=pension, oa=old age), <strong>d</strong>
stands for <strong>demographic</strong> (e.g. dag: d=demographic, ag=age), <strong>l</strong> stands for <strong>labour market</strong> (e.g. les: l=labour
market, es=economic status), <strong>y</strong> stands for <strong>income</strong>
(e.g. yem: y=income, em=employment), <strong>a</strong>
stands for <strong>assets</strong> (e.g. afc: a=assets, fc=financial
capital), <strong>x</strong> stands for <strong>expenditure</strong> (e.g. xcc: x=expenditure, cc=child care), <strong>k</strong> stands for <strong>in kind</strong> (e.g. ked: k=in kind, ed=education) and <strong>s</strong>
stands for <strong>system</strong> (e.g. stm01: s=system, tm=temporary variable).</li>

<li>The rest of the name is composed of
two-character acronyms. Take for example the variable <i>tsceehl_s</i>: <strong>t</strong> stands for <strong>tax</strong>, <strong>sc</strong> stands for <strong>social insurance contributions</strong>, <strong>ee</strong> stands for <strong>employee</strong>, <strong>hl</strong> stands for <strong>health</strong> and <strong>_s</strong> stands for <strong>simulated</strong>.
Thus the variable stores employee's health social insurance contributions as
calculated by the model.</li>
</ul

<p>EUROMOD variables are stored in a special EUROMOD parameter
file, the variable description file <i>VarConfig.xml</i> (see <a href="EM_FS_OrganisationOfFiles.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
content (parameter files) - Organisation of files</a> for the storage
place and <a href="EM_FS_VariablesFile.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD content (parameter
files) - Format of the variables file</a> for the content of this file). The file
contains the names of the available variables together with their properties.
Some of the properties serve the model to distinguish if certain routines
should be applied on the variable, for example only monetary variables are
up-rated. Others are mere information, for example, there is a verbal
description of each variable (<i>Automatic
Label</i>), and a special description for each country. Moreover, the variable
description file stores the acronyms of which the variable names are composed.</p>

<p>Note that in addition to these standardised variables, there
are variables which are defined during the model run using the functions <a
href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst.htm"><i>DefVar</i></a>
and <a href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst"><i>DefConst</i></a> (see <a href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD
Basic Concepts – EUROMOD terminology</a> paragraph <i>EUROMOD variables</i>).</p>

<h4>Administrating
variables and acronyms in the EUROMOD user interface</h4>

<p>The EUROMOD user interface provides a tool, which allows
administrating the information stored in the variable description file. To
assess this tool press the button <i>Variables</i>
in the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i>.</p>

<p>The left part of the tool's surface shows the list of all
available EUROMOD variables. For each variable there is a
checkbox indicating whether the variable is monetary (checked) or not (not
checked) and a verbal description. This description is called <i>Automatic Label</i>, indicating that it is
automatically generated out of the acronyms building the variable's name, thus
the user cannot edit it. Moreover, if a variable is selected, country specific
descriptions are listed below the list of variables. These descriptions are
editable.</p>

<p>The right part of the tool's surface shows all available
acronyms organised in a tree in three levels. The first level exhibits the type
as described above (benefit, tax, income, ...). The
second level subdivides types into so called &quot;levels&quot;. The levels
mainly serve a better overview.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
Finally, the third level shows the acronyms themselves together with a verbal
description, which is used to generate the <i>Automatic
Labels</i> of the variables using the respective acronym. If an acronym is
categorical (e.g. gender has two categories: male and female), selecting the
acronym lists the respective categories below the list of acronyms.</p>

<p>Note the possibilities of adapting the size of the window,
and therewith the lists, according to your
requirements. In particular note that the window is vertically tiled, i.e. if
you move the mouse between the upper (<i>Variables,
Acronyms</i>) and lower lists (<i>Descriptions,
Categories</i>) a cursor appears, which allows to resize the upper and lower
window part.</p>
