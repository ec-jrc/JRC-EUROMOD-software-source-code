<h1>Connecting to a VC project</h1>

<p>The following explanations describe how most users will initially come into contact with 
EUROMOD version control. That is by, firstly, logging-in to the EUROMOD version control 
system and, secondly, by establishing a connection between their <i>local project</i> and 
<i>a VC project</i> stored on version control.</p>

<h4>Logging-in to the EUROMOD version control system</h4>

<p>The first time you go to the <i>Version Control</i> ribbon, you will see (at the very left) 
a closed door with the text <i>Click to Log In</i> underneath. Clicking this button will open 
the login dialog. The dialog asks you for a <i>User Name</i> and <i>Password</i>. Both should 
be at your disposal; if not, then you have to get them from the EUROMOD team. Once you enter 
the required information and click <i>OK</i>, the connection to the EUROMOD version control 
system is established.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Note that every time 
you close EUROMOD you are automatically logged out and you will need to repeat this process.</p>

<p>Now you are connected to the EUROMOD version control system. The user interface visualises 
this by showing a door with a red sign (with the text <i>Log Out</i>) instead of the door with the green sign.
Moreover, you are now able to perform several actions (depending on your access rights), such 
as <a href="EM_VC_WFI_DownloadingRelease.htm">downloading a bundle</a> or even 
some of the <a href="EM_VC_WFI_Admin.htm">admin functions</a>, such as creating/removing a project
in VC. Still, in order to unlock the full capabilities of Version Control, you need to 
connect your local project to a VC project. The necessary steps to establish such a connection 
are described in the next section.</p>

<h4>Establishing connection to a VC project</h4>

<p>The <i>Version Control</i> ribbon shows in the section <i>NEW ONLINE BUNDLE</i> a chain symbol 
with the text <i>Connect</i> underneath. Following this instruction opens a dialog 
which offers all <i>available Version-Controlled (VC) Projects</i> for selection. Which projects 
are available and thus displayed depend on your user rights<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. 
To connect your local project to one of the available VC projects, you need 
to select it and press <i>OK</i>.</p>

<p>Once your local project is connected with a VC project, this will show on the application's 
title bar where the text &quot;Connected to VC: &lt;ProjectName&gt;&quot; will be added to the 
local project information. Furthermore, you will now be able to complete more VC actions, such as 
<a href="EM_VC_WFI_GeneratingRelease.htm">starting a new merge</a> or <a href="EM_VC_WFI_Admin.htm">
administering the VC project</a>. Note that as soon as you connect to a VC project, you will get 
a notification in case there is someone currently performing a merge, or there is an unfinished 
merge pending by yourself.</p>

<h4>Synchronising local project with a VC project</h4>

<p>There are two reasons for synchronising your local project with a VC project: either you need to take the latest
available version online to update your local project, or you may want to upload your latest changes to the VC project 
(or a combination of the two). If you want to update your local project, then you need to use the 
<a href="EM_VC_DownloadRelease.htm"><i>Download Bundle</i></a> button. This will present you with the <i>Version Control 
- Download Bundle</i> form, allowing you to perform a different option for each unit (country, addon etc.) with a choice 
between keeping your local version, overwriting it with the online (VC) version or merging the two if both have new 
changes. If on the other hand you want to update the VC project with changes you have done locally, then you need to use
the <a href="EM_VC_StartFinishMerging.htm"><i>Start new online bundle</i></a> button and follow the steps to create a new bundle. </p>
