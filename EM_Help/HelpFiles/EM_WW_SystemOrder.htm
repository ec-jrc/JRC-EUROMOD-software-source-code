<h1>Changing the left to right
order of systems</h1>

<p>The order of systems from left to right is changed by using
drag and drop, i.e. clicking a system's header with the left mouse button,
dragging the system with pressed mouse button to the new position and dropping
it there by releasing the mouse button. Note however, that this new position is
not permanent. This means that, if the country is closed and opened again, the system
will be back to its old position, even if the country is saved.</p>

<h4>Saving a new order of
systems</h4>

<p>To make a new order of systems permanent, click any system's
header to open the system context menu and select the menu item <i>Save System Order</i>. Note that this change
is initially only valid for the current session (see <i>Restore System Order</i> below). To become valid for further sessions
the country must be saved.</p>

<h4>Restoring the initial
order of systems</h4>

<p>One can restore the order of systems by right clicking any system's
header to open the system context menu and selecting the menu item <i>Restore System Order</i>. The thus restored
order is the order one came upon when the country was initially opened, unless meanwhile
a new order was stored via <i>Save System
Order</i> (see above), in which case this order is restored.</p>
