<h1>Acronym Administration</h1>

<p>The following operations are performed with the <i><strong>variable administration tool</strong></i>. To open this
tool press the button <i>Variables</i> in
the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> (also
see <a href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD
- Administration of EUROMOD variables</a> paragraph <i>Administrating variables and acronyms in the EUROMOD user interface</i>).</p>

<h4>Listing of acronyms</h4>

<p>The variable administration tool lists in its right part all
acronyms available for generating variable names (see the Data Requirement
Document (DRD) for detailed information concerning the generation of variable
names). The acronyms are organised in a tree with three levels. The first level
exhibits the variable<i> <strong>type</strong></i>, i.e. DEOMOGRAPHIC, TAX, INCOME, etc. The
second level subdivides types into <i><strong>levels</strong></i>. The levels mainly serve a better
overview.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
Finally, the third level shows the acronyms themselves together with a verbal
description, which is used to generate the <i>Automatic
Labels</i> of the variables, which use the respective acronyms. If an acronym
is categorical (e.g. gender has two categories: male and female), selecting
this acronym in the <i>Acronyms</i> list
displays the categories in the <i>Categories</i>
list (locate below the <i>Acronyms</i> list).</p>

<h4>Adding types</h4>

<p>Click the button <i>Add
Type</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> of
the variable administration tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Alt-T</i>. This appends a new empty type row
at the end of the <i>Acronyms</i> list.</p>

<h4>Changing types</h4>

<p>To change a type's <i>Description</i>
(DEOMOGRAPHIC, TAX, INCOME, etc.) or <i>Acronym</i>
(D, T, Y, etc.) simply edit the respective cell. In the case of changing the <i>Acronym</i> the interface checks if the <i>Acronym</i> is already used by another type
and, if so, issues a respective message and prevents the change to avoid
ambiguousness. Moreover, the interface checks whether the <i>Acronym</i> is used in the current listing of variables. If so, a
warning is issued, which lists the variables concerned. The user is still able
to accomplish the change, however the description (<i>Automatic Label</i>) of the variables will
show up question marks to indicate unknown acronyms.</p>

<h4>Deleting types</h4>

<p>Select the type to delete and click the button <i>Delete Type</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> of the variable administration
tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Ctrl-Shift-T</i>.
The interface checks whether this type is used in the current listing of
variables. If so, a warning is issued, which lists the variables concerned. The
user is still able to accomplish the removal, however
the description (<i>Automatic Label</i>) of
the variables concerned will show up question marks to indicate unknown
acronyms.</p>

<h4>Adding levels</h4>

<p>Click the button <i>Add
Level</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> of
the variable administration tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Alt-L</i>. This adds a new empty level row.
Note that, other than for types and acronyms, the order of levels is relevant,
thus the interface does not simply append the row, but uses the selected row as
orientation: if another level row or an acronym row is selected, the new row is
inserted below the respective level. If a type row is selected, the level is
inserted as the first level of this type.</p>

<h4>Changing levels</h4>

<p>To change a level's <i>description</i>,
simply edit the respective cell. Note that, other than types and acronyms, levels
do not possess an <i>Acronym</i> (thus the
respective cell is not editable), reflecting that levels are not directly used
in generating the <i>Automatic Label</i> of
variables.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<h4>Deleting levels</h4>

<p>Select the level to delete and click the button <i>Delete Level</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> of the variable administration
tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Ctrl-Shift-L</i>.
The interface checks whether acronyms of this level are used in the current
listing of variables. If so, a warning is issued, which lists the variables
concerned. The user is still able to accomplish the removal,
however the description (<i>Automatic Label</i>)
of the variables concerned will show up question marks to indicate unknown
acronyms.</p>

<h4>Adding acronyms</h4>

<p>Select the level, where to add the new acronym (or select
another acronym within the level) and click the button <i>Add Acronym</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i>
of the variable administration tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Alt-A</i>. This appends a new empty acronym
row at the end of the level.</p>

<h4>Changing acronyms</h4>

<p>To change an acronym's <i>Description</i>
(age, gender, etc.) or <i>Acronym</i> (AG,
GN, etc.) simply edit the respective cell. In the case of changing the <i>Acronym</i> the interface checks if the
acronym is already used within this type or is incorrect, i.e. does not consist
of two characters. If so, a respective message is issued and the change is
prevented to avoid ambiguousness. Moreover, the interface checks whether an
acronym is used in the current listing of variables. If so, a warning is
issued, which lists the variables concerned. The user is still able to
accomplish the change, however the description (<i>Automatic Label</i>) of the variables
concerned will show up question marks to indicate unknown acronyms.</p>

<h4>Deleting acronyms</h4>

<p>Select the acronym to delete and click the button <i>Delete Acronym</i> in the ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> of the variable administration
tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Ctrl-Shift-A</i>.
The interface checks whether the acronym is used in the current listing of
variables. If so, a warning is issued, which lists the variables concerned. The
user is still able to accomplish the removal, however
the description (<i>Automatic Label</i>) of
the variables will show up question marks to indicate unknown acronyms.</p>

<h4>Searching acronyms</h4>

<p>The <i>Search</i> buttons at the top right of the
ribbon <i>Acronyms</i> allow for searching
acronyms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The button <i>Acronyms</i>
searches for the acronym as specified in the fields left of the buttons. This is also 
the default search if you press Enter in the search text field. Select
the acronym type (DEOMOGRAPHIC, TAX, INCOME, etc.) in the upper field and the
searched acronym in the field below. Pressing the button selects the matched acronym. 
Note that, if ALL ACRONYMS is selected instead of a specific type, several matches may
be found, as acronyms need to be unique only within a type. If more than one occurrence 
is found, an info box appears showing all the matches. Matches will appear in black colour 
(blue when hovered) and clicking them will select the corresponding acronym in the acronym 
tree. Also note that a full acronym description tooltip appears if you hover the mouse over 
any of the matches.</li>

<li>The button <i>Description</i>
searches for acronyms with a description as specified in the fields left of the
button. Select the acronym type (DEOMOGRAPHIC, TAX, INCOME, etc.) in the upper
field and the searched description in the field below. Note that search patterns <i>?</i> and <i>*</i> can be used
(and most likely will), where <i>?</i> stands for one arbitrary character and <i>*</i> for any number of arbitrary characters (examples: *child*, *wom?n*). Pressing the button selects the matched acronym. 
If more than one occurrence is found, an info box appears showing all the matches. 
Matches will appear in black colour (blue when hovered) and clicking them will select 
the corresponding acronym in the acronym tree. Also note that a full acronym description 
tooltip appears if you hover the mouse over any of the matches.
</li>
</ul>
