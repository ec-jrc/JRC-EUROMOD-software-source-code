<h1>Compare and merge bundle</h1>

<p>This form allows users to synchronise their local project with content from a given VC project/bundle. 
You can access this form by clicking the <i>Compare and merge bundle</i> button in the <i>Version Control</i> 
ribbon's section <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i>.</p>

<p>The process of synchronise your local project is completed in three steps: choose the VC project, choose 
the bundle, choose the actions.</p>

<h4>Choose the project</h4>
<p>The <i>Project</i> combo-box on the top of the form, will allow you to select the VC project with which 
you want to synchronise your local project. If your local project is already connected to a VC project, 
then this VC project will appear preselected in the <i>Project</i> combo-box. Selecting a VC project will
fill the <i>Bundle</i> combo-box with the available bundles for this project.</p>

<h4>Choose the bundle</h4>
<p>The <i>Bundle</i> combo-box (located just below the <i>Project</i> combo-box), will allow you to select
a particular bundle (or version) of the VC project that you want to synchronise your local project with.
You can get more info for a specific bundle after you select it by clicking the <i>Full Info</i> button 
next to it. Once you select a given bundle, the application will download all the bundle details (this may 
take a while) and compare each available unit to your local project. This information will then be displayed 
in the grid below, listing for each available unit its <i>Name</i>, <i>Type</i>, <i>Version</i> info (date & 
bundle it was commited to), its <i>Local Status</i> and a set of available actions that you can perform. The 
<i>Local Status</i> can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Corresponds</i>: meaning that the local unit is identical to the VC unit.</li>
	<li><i>Differs</i>: meaning that the local unit is different to the VC unit.</li>
	<li><i>Missing</i>: meaning that the local unit does not exist at all.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Choose the action for each unit</h4>
<p>There are three possible actions for each unit:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Get Online Version</i>: meaning that you will download the VC unit and overwrite your local unit.
	Note that any not uploaded changes of the former local unit will be lost.</li>
	<li><i>Keep Local Version</i>: meaning in fact no action, i.e. the VC unit is not downloaded.</li>
	<li><i>Get Merge Support</i>: will download the VC unit in a special folder and build a merging environment
	allowing you to use the <i>Merge Tool</i> to consolidate the two versions (VC & local). For more information 
	on merging see <a href="EM_VC_MergeTool.htm">The Merge Tool</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the <i>Type</i> and <i>Local Status</i> of each unit, some of these actions may be disabled. For 
example if your local unit already <i>corresponds</i> to the VC unit, then all actions will be disabled as there 
is nothing further to be done. Similarly, if the unit type is not supported by the <i>Merge Tool</i>, the <i>Get 
Merge Support</i> action will be disabled.</p>

<p>In order to make the action selection process more efficient, just under the grid on the right side you will
also find three buttons that allow you to change the selected action for all units with one click: <i>Get All</i>, 
<i>Keep All</i> and <i>Merge All</i>. These will of course only affect units for which the action is available.</p>

<p>Once you have selected all the required actions, you can click on the <i>Download</i> button to complete the
synchronisation process.</p>
