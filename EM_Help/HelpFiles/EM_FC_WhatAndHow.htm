<h1>What are functions and how are they used</h1>

<p>EUROMOD functions are building blocks that
allow EUROMOD modellers to implement a country’s tax-benefit system. Each
policy (tax/benefit) is described by one or more such functions. Modellers
specify how EUROMOD calculates the policy by setting the parameters of the
functions to appropriate values.</p>
