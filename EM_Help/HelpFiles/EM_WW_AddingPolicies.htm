<h1>Adding Policies</h1>

<h4>Adding a policy</h4>

<p>To add a policy right click the name of the policy before
respectively after which you want to insert the new policy. This opens the policy's
context menu, where you select the menu item <i>Add Policy Before</i> respectively <i>Add
Policy After</i>. A sub menu opens, which allows choosing the type of the new policy
(benefit, tax, ...). Click the respective policy type to open a dialog where
you are asked to indicate the new policy's name. Clicking <i>OK</i> adds the new policy. Note that the policy's name must not contain
any other characters than letters, numbers and underscores. If any other
character is used or if the chosen name is equal to an existing policy's name,
an error message is issued, and you are asked to change the name. Moreover, the
policy name is by convention expected to end with an underscore followed by the
country's short name (e.g. _hu, _be, _uk, etc.). If this is not the case the
user interface asks whether it should add this ending for you. You may answer
this question with <i>No</i> to use a
non-standard policy name, it is however recommended to answer with <i>Yes</i>.</p>

<h4>Adding the very first policy</h4>

<p>The system context menu (opened by right clicking any system's
header) offers the menu item <i>Insert First
Policy</i>. This menu item is disabled unless the country does not yet contain
any policy. Select the menu item to open a dialog where you are asked to
indicate the new policy's name and click <i>OK</i>
to add the policy. Note that the same naming conventions are valid as explained
above.</p>

<h4>Renaming a policy</h4>

<p>To change the name of a policy right click its current name.
This opens the policy's context menu where you select the menu item <i>Rename Policy</i>. A dialog opens where you
are asked to indicate the new name of the policy. Click <i>OK</i> to confirm the change. Note that the same naming conventions are
valid as explained above.</p>
