<h1>The special function ChangeParam</h1>

<p>The function ChangeParam
allows for changing the values of parameters of other functions. Of course
usually one would not use a function for this purpose, but change the
parameters directly. There are however some cases where using ChangeParam instead makes sense. 
An evident example is changing parameters from an add-on. In
fact, the usage of ChangeParam in add-ons is near to inevitable – how else
should parameters of the countries' parameter files be changed from the add-on
parameter file? Another case concerns changing parameters from a reform
policy without directly changing base policy parameters. Though the reform
could as well be implemented in the respective policy sheets (still transparent
by using a reform system), in some cases it may be more transparent to
summarise the changes in an extra reform policy.</p>

<p>Each parameter change requires two parameters. Firstly, the parameter to change
needs to be specified by Param_Id, which allows the indication of a unique
identifier for the parameter. Secondly, the new value for the parameter is
indicated by the parameter Param_NewVal. The value type of this parameter
is determined by the value type of the parameter it changes. That means if
the parameter to be changed indicates a yes/no parameter, Param_NewVal also needs to be set either to yes or no.</p>

<p>ChangeParam is independent of the policy/function order defined by the spine. It simply overwrites the former
value of the parameter (at read-time) and the program runs as if this value
never existed. As a consequence, the function can be located anywhere, without
changing its behaviour.</p>

<p>The optional parameter Dataset can be used to restrict the change to specific datasets.<br>
If any such parameter is used (several can be used within one group), the change only takes place if one of them matches the dataset of the concerned run.<br>
The wildcards * and ? can be used, where * stands for any character and ? stands for one arbitrary character (e.g.be_20 * _a ?).</p>

<p>Note that, while the EM2 executable allows for also using ChangeParam to change switches of policies or functions, 
the EM3 executable provides the function <a href="EM_FC_ChangeSwitch.htm">ChangeSwitch</a> for this task.<br>
Also note that changing parameters at run-time (as it was possible with reservations with the EM2 executable by using parameter Param_CondVal) 
is not possible with the EM3 executable.</p>
