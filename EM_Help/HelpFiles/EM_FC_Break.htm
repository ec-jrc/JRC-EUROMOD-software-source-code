<h1>The special function Break</h1>

<p>The function Break allows the user to break the run at any point inside the spine. This function 
is only intendent to be used during the development stage of a system to help the developer locate and
fix bugs in such system. It is not intendent to be included in published models.</p>

<p class="EM3only">This function is only available with EM3.</p>

<table class="spine">
	<caption>Example 1:</caption>
	<tr class="policy">
		<td>Policy</td>
		<td>Grp/No</td>
		<td class="system">SL_demo</td>
		<td>Comment</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="function">
		<td>Break</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>on</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In the above example the execution will immediately stop once the Break function is reached, and EUROMOD 
will produce an output file (taking the name from the first DefOutput to be found after the Break function, 
which will typically be the default output function) that contains ALL variables and incomelists available at the time. 
Note that outputting incomelists will very likely lead to issuing warnings "... use of not initialised variable ...", 
referring to variables which are included in the incomelists, but only generated after the break.</p>

<p>A more controlled behaviour is shown in the next example:</p>

<table class="spine">
	<caption>Example 2:</caption>
	<tr class="policy">
		<td>Policy</td>
		<td>Grp/No</td>
		<td class="system">SL_demo</td>
		<td>Comment</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="function">
		<td>Break</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>on</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ProduceOutput</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>OutputFileName</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>C:\MyFiles\debugging.txt</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ProduceTUinfo</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In example 2, the execution will immediately stop once the Break function is reached, as before, but EUROMOD 
will this time produce an output file in the specified location and name. If only the filename is specified, 
then it will be generated in the default output folder (same as the DefOutput works). This file will not only 
contain variables and incomelists, but also all at the time available TU info.</p>
