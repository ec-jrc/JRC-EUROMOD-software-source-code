<h1>EUROMOD Version Control</h1>

<p>The help for EUROMOD version control is split in two parts</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workflow guide & basic concepts</strong> and</li>

<li><strong>VC forms & functions</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Workflow guide & basic concepts</strong> pages, in principle, can
be read like a textbook. They instruct users in a twofold way: Firstly, they
provide them with the knowledge they need to understand EUROMOD version
control. Secondly, they give how-to-do instructions on the operations necessary
for Version Control. The work flow instructions are arranged bottom-up. That
means they start with instructions for general usage, i.e. tasks most users
will need to know and/or will operate with higher frequency. This is followed
by instructions for less frequent use and by less users (e.g. administrative
tasks).</p>

<p>The <strong>VC forms & functions</strong> are of more technical
nature. They concentrate on describing the technical procedure and sometimes
provide technical background. Moreover, they are more comprehensive than the
work flow instructions which sometimes concentrate on the most usual
applications. The VC forms & functions pages are from time to time referenced in
the work flow instructions, so that the latter can concentrate on &quot;what's
going on&quot; while the former explain &quot;how that's accomplished&quot;.
Obviously reading this part of the help like a textbook does not make sense,
rather it is accessed via a search request or via the work flow instructions.</p>
