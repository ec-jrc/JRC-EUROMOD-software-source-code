<h1>Summary Statistics plug-in</h1>

<h4>What is the Summary Statistics plug-in?</h4>

<p>The Summary Statistics plugin is an analysis tool that produces a fixed set of statistics 
on income distribution based on (a) EUROMOD output file(s).</p>

<h4>Where can I find this?</h4>

<p>You can find the Summary Statistics plugin under the "Applications" toolbar 
ribbon, inside the "EUROMOD plugins" group.</p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

<p>When you run the Summary Statistics plugin you are presented with an input form which 
allows you to specify a path to a base directory. This should be the directory where your output files are 
stored. You should then specify on which files you want to perform calculations by adding/removing files. 
Once you have selected the files you want to analyse, click on the "Calculate Statistics" button.</p>

<p>After the files have been read and analysed, you will be presented with the results form. 
This has an outer tab control with one tab page for each system/file you analysed. Each tab page has
one inner tab control, whose tab pages hold different tables with the summarized statistics results. 
You can copy-paste any selected cells from these tables, either by pressing Ctrl+C on your keyboard or 
by right-clicking your mouse and selecting the "Copy" command from the context menu. You can also export
all the calculated statistics (all tables of all systems/countries) into one single Excel file, by clicking 
on the "Export" button.</p>
