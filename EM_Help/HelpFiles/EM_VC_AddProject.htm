<h1>Add VC Project</h1>

<p>You can create a new VC project by clicking the <i>Add VC Project</i></a> button, 
which you can find in the <i>NEW VC PROJECT</i> section of the VC ribbon. In order to do this, 
you need to be <a href="EM_VC_LogInOut.htm">logged in</a> to Version Control
and also to have the required access rights. Please note that the dialog suggests the 
name of the local project<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
(i.e. the project loaded by the user interface). Also note, that if you are already connected to a VC project, 
you will be asked to disconnect first. After typing the project's name, pressing the button <i>OK</i> generates the new project remotely (i.e. on the version control
system). This is confirmed by a respective success message and you are also automatically
connected to the new VC project.</p>

<p>As a next step you would then need to click the <i>Administrate 
Content</i> button to add your local units to the new VC project (see <a href="EM_VC_AdminContent.htm">Administrate Content</a>).</p>

<p>Please note that the new VC project, after creation, has only
one user<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, i.e. the user that generated the project. The user has full
admin-rights on the project and may want to add other users by clicking 
the <i>Administrate Users</i> button (see <a
href="EM_VC_AdminUsers.htm">Administrate Users</a>).</p>
