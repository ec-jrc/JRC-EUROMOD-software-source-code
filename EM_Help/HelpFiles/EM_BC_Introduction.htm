<h1>EUROMOD Basic Concepts</h1>

<h4>What is EUROMOD?</h4>

<p>EUROMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union (EU) that enables researchers and policy analysts to calculate, in a comparable manner, the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. As well as calculating the effects of actual policies it is also used to evaluate the effects of tax-benefit policy reforms and other changes on poverty, inequality, incentives and government budgets.</p>

<h4>What can EUROMOD do?</h4>

<p>EUROMOD can be used in many different ways in different contexts. Examples include:</p>

<h5>Standard</h5>

<ul>
<li>Estimation of poverty, inequality and redistribution statistics under actual conditions, previous or future tax-benefit rules</li>

<li>Budgetary effects</li>

<li>Effects of simple tax-benefit policy reforms (or illustrative changes to household composition and original income)</li>

<li>&quot;Model family&quot; calculations</li>

<li>Indicators of work incentives</li>
</ul>
<h5>More advanced</h5>
<ul>
<li>Complex policy reforms (e.g. effects of revenue-neutral changes to tax rates and social insurance regulations)</li>

<li>Policy swapping between countries (i.e. effects on country A of adopting a policy measure currently effective in country B) Generation of budget sets as input to labour supply or other models of behaviour change Generation of counterfactual income to answer &quot;what if&quot; questions Assessing effects and costs of EU-wide policy reforms.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Data imputation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Generation of gross income (by source) from net, or vice versa</li>
</ul>
