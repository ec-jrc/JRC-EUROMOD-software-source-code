<h1>The EUROMOD user interface</h1>

<p>The EUROMOD user interface is the central accession point of
the model. Its purpose is to help users to orientate themselves within the
options provided by the model and around the model.</p>

<p>The user interface's main window shows the following
components:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Countries </i></strong>is filled with flags for the implemented
	countries. The flags can be clicked to access the EUROMOD parameters of the
	respective country. EUROMOD parameters store the information the model needs
	for its calculations. How the user interface presents this information is
	explained in <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">Presentation of countries'
	tax-benefit-systems</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>The button<i> Run EUROMOD</i></strong> left of the ribbon <i>Countries</i> opens the EUROMOD <i>run dialog</i>, which is explained in <a
	href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Country Tools</i></strong> enables access to a number of dialogs, which support working with a
	country's parameters. These dialogs allow for</li>
	<ul>
		<li>configuring country settings (e.g. name, short
			name), system settings (e.g. currency, exchange rate to Euro) and the input
			datasets which can be used for simulating the country's tax benefit system (see
			section <a href="EM_WW_ConfiguringDatasets.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Changing
			Countries' Settings</a>),</li>
		<li>offer a number of search tools, which - besides
			allowing for standard searching and replacing - facilitate finding errors and
			assessing if and where certain EUROMOD components (e.g. variables) are used in
			the respective country's parameters (see section <a
			href="EM_WW_SearchReplace.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Searching</a>),</li>
		<li>offer a number of
			formatting tools, e.g. highlighting with colours and setting bookmarks (see
			section <a href="EM_WW_ConditionalFormatting.htm">Working with EUROMOD -
			Formatting</a>).</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Administration Tools</i></strong> enables
	access to dialogs which allow for:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>adding and deleting of countries (see <a
			href="EM_WW_AddingCountries.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Adding countries</a>
			and <a href="EM_WW_DeletingCountries.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Deleting
			countries</a>),</li>
		<li>administrating EUROMOD's variables (see <a
			href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD
			variables</a>),</li>
		<li>generating EUROMOD public
			versions (see <a href="EM_WW_PublicVersion.htm">Working with EUROMOD -
			Generating a EUROMOD public version</a>).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><strong>The ribbon <i>Add-Ons</i></strong>
	is filled with icons for the available EUROMOD add-ons. The icons can be
	clicked to access the implementation of the respective add-on. The presentation
	of add-on implementations is equal to the presentation of country
	implementations and can therefore be looked up in <a
	href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">Presentation of countries'
	tax-benefit-systems</a>. For more information on add-ons and an example see <a
	href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD Functions - EUROMOD add-ons and the
	special functions AddOn_Applic, AddOn_Pol,
	AddOn_Func and AddOnPar</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>The ribbon <i>Applications</i></strong> enables access to
	a number of tools, which allow for analysing the EUROMOD output, respectively
	preparing the EUROMOD input (see section <a href="EM_WW_Applications.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Applications</a>). They comprise</li>
	<ul>
		<li>a tool for generating simple summary statistics,</li>
		<li>a tool for generating budget constraints,</li>
		<li>a tool for generating hypothetical input data.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>The main menu</strong> left of the <i>Run EUROMOD</i> button contains functionalities like saving countries'
	parameters, opening projects, changing configuration, getting help and
	information as well as exiting the programme. These functionalities are
	described at appropriate points in the section <a href="EM_WW_HeaderPage.htm">Working with EUROMOD</a>.</li>
</ul>
