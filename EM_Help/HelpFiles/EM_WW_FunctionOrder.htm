<h1>Changing the order of
functions</h1>

<p>There are three ways to change the order of functions: by
using (a) drag and drop, (b) key <i>Up</i> /
key <i>Down</i> or (c) the function context
menu. For each of them first select the respective functions. A single function
is selected by simply clicking it (more precisely, its name in the <i>Policy</i> column). A range of functions is
selected by selecting the first function (i.e. its name in the <i>Policy</i> column), then pressing and
holding the <i>Shift</i> key while selecting
the last function. Light blue back colour shows the selection. For a more
detailed description of how to select cells see <a href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working
with EUROMOD – Selecting components and values</a>.</p>

<p>For (a) click the respective functions with the left mouse
button, drag them with pressed mouse button to the new position and drop them
there by releasing the mouse button.</p>

<p>For (b) press the <i>Control</i>
as well as the <i>Up</i> key to move the
respective functions up, respectively the <i>Control</i>
as well as the <i>Down</i> key to move them
down.</p>

<p>For (c) right click the name of (one of the) functions for
opening the context menu and selecting the menu item <i>Move Functions Up</i> respectively <i>Move
Functions Down</i>.</p>

<p>Note that functions can only be shifted (up or down) within
the policy they belong to. That means, this way it is not possible to move a
function from one policy to another. It is however possible to copy a function
into another policy (see <a href="EM_WW_CopyingFunctions.htm">Working with
EUROMOD - Copying functions</a>) and possibly (if the intention is to move the
function) delete the original function.</p>

<p>Also note that changing the order of functions invokes a
warning, asking &quot;Are you sure you want to change the order of
calculations?&quot;. See <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">EUROMOD Basic
Concepts - Presentation of countries' tax-benefit systems</a> and <a
href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - Terminology</a> for more
information on the EUROMOD spine and the consequences of reordering functions.
To avoid the warning see <a href="EM_WW_ManagingWarnings.htm">Working with
EUROMOD - Managing warnings</a>.</p>
