<h1>Deleting functions</h1>

<p>Functions can be deleted by either using the context menu or
via the <i>Delete</i>-key. In both cases
first select the function(s) you want to delete. Then press the <i>Delete</i>-key. Alternatively right click the
name of (one of) the function(s) for opening the context menu and selecting the
menu item <i>Delete Function(s)</i>.</p>

<p>A single function is selected by simply clicking it (more
precisely, its name in the <i>Policy</i>
column). A range of functions is selected by selecting the first function (i.e.
its name in the <i>Policy</i> column), then
pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i> key
while selecting the last function. Light blue back colour shows the selection.
For a more detailed description of how to select cells see <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD – Selecting components and
values</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection needs to include the <i>Policy</i> column (i.e. the name(s) of the
function(s)). If only system columns and/or the group or comment columns are
selected, the interface assumes that the respective <i>values</i> should be deleted – see <a
href="EM_WW_ChangingParameters.htm">Working with EUROMOD – Changing parameters</a>
(paragraph <i>Deleting (ranges of) parameter
values</i>). Moreover, if you use the context menu, you need to open it via a
function contained in the selection, otherwise not the selected functions are
deleted, but the function that belongs to the context menu. In addition note
that with the context menu it is only possible to delete functions belonging to
one policy – use the <i>Delete</i>-key if
you want to delete a wider range of components.</p>

<p>A security question is issued before the functions are
finally removed. Note that you can opt to not show the security query anymore -
see <a href="EM_WW_ManagingWarnings.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Managing
warnings</a>.</p>
