<h1>Changing policy view and
jumping to a specific policy</h1>

<p>The user interface allows for two modes for viewing a
country's tax-benefit policies. The standard mode is &quot;<i>Full Spine View</i>&quot;, that means all policies are displayed. For reasons
of clarity or to enhance performance one may however prefer to view only one
policy at once, i.e. work with &quot;<i>Single
Policy View</i>&quot;. The ribbon <i>Display</i> 
provides check-boxes allowing for changing between the two views.</p>

<p>If one changes from <i>Full
Spine View</i> to <i>Single Policy View</i>,
the single policy displayed is the focused policy. Initially the policy is
fully expanded, that means all functions and parameters are displayed. To
select another policy click the <i>Policy</i>
column's header with the left mouse button. This opens a list of all policies,
thus allowing for selecting the required one. The user interface
&quot;remembers&quot; this policy during the session. That means if one
switches back to <i>Full Spine View</i> and
then again back to <i>Single Policy View</i>
the displayed policy is the one displayed before the switches.</p>

<p>Working in <i>Single
Policy View</i> is in principal not different from working in <i>Full Spine View</i>. Just a few operations
are not possible and therefore deactivated. These operations include adding and
deleting policies and operations which work on the full spine (e.g.
importing/exporting systems).</p>

<p>Note that the list of all policies activated by a left mouse
click on the <i>Policy</i> column is also
available in <i>Full Spine View</i>, where
it serves to jumping to the selected policy. This functionality may be handy if
many policies and functions are expanded.</p>
