<h1>The Hidden Systems Box</h1>

<p>The system context menu's item <i>Move To Hidden Systems Box ...</i> shows a couple of sub menu items<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, which
provide options for hiding and unhiding systems from the main view. These
options are helpful for reasons of manageability, for example if a reform
scenario is implemented and one wants to concentrate on this system and maybe
its base system.</p>

<h4>Hiding Systems</h4>

<p>Systems hidden from the main view are listed in the <i>Hidden Systems Box</i>. This is a small
window, which is displayed by clicking on the <i>Show Hidden Systems Box</i> button in the <i>Display </i>ribbon or by choosing the sub menu item <i>Show Hidden Systems Box</i> or by any of the
following sub menu items. Note that the term &quot;selected system&quot; used
below refers to the system that was right clicked to open the system context
menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub menu item <i>Selected System</i>:</strong> Selecting this option hides the selected system.</li>

<li><strong>Sub menu item <i>All Systems But Selected</i>:</strong> Selecting this option hides all other
systems, while only the selected systems remains visible.</li>

<li><strong>Sub menu item <i>Select Systems ...</i>:</strong> Selecting this option provides a list of all
visible systems and allows selecting them for hiding. Note that clicking <i>OK</i> without selecting any system, though
not having any effect on system visibility, may still (re)show the <i>Hidden System Box</i> (if it was closed via
its close box).</li>

<li><strong>Using Drag and Drop:</strong> One can also hide systems by dragging them into the <i>Hidden System Box</i>, i.e. clicking the
respective system's header with the left mouse button, dragging the system with
pressed mouse button over the <i>Hidden
System Box</i> and dropping it there by releasing the mouse button.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unhiding Systems</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub menu item <i>Unhide all Systems</i>:</strong> Selecting this options reshows all hidden
systems, i.e. the systems listed in the<i>
Hidden System Box</i>.</li>

<li><strong>Using Drag and Drop:</strong> One can also unhide a
system by dragging it from the <i>Hidden System Box</i> to its old or any
other position (see <a href="EM_WW_SystemOrder.htm">Working with EUROMOD -
Changing the order of systems</a> for more information with respect to the
order of systems).</li>

<li><strong>Double clicking the system in the <i>Hidden System Box</i>:</strong> This reshows the
system and shows it as the last one, i.e. just left of the comments column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the user interface draws the attention to any
changes, which could affect hidden systems. If for example a function is
deleted a warning will be issued, which asks you to <i>&quot;Please note that the action will have effect on the hidden
systems as well!&quot;</i>. (See <a href="EM_WW_ManagingWarnings.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Managing warnings</a> for avoiding such warnings.)</p>
