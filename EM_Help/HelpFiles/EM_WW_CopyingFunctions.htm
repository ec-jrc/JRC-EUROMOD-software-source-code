<h1>Copying functions within a country</h1>

<p>To copy a single function right-click its name, which opens
the function’s context menu, where you select the menu item <i>Copy Function(s)</i>.</p>

<p>To copy several functions, first select the respective
functions, then click within the selection to open the
context menu providing the menu item <i>Copy
Function(s)</i>. Note that the selection needs to include the policy column and
that the right-click must be performed in the policy column as well. Moreover,
note that only functions of one policy can be copied at the same time - a
warning is issued if the selection does not fulfil this criterion. (For a description
of how to select functions see <a href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with
EUROMOD – Selecting components and values</a>.)</p>

<p>To paste the copied function(s) right-click the name of the
function before or after which you want to insert the copy. From the<i> </i>context menu select the menu item <i>Paste Function(s) Before</i> to place the
copied function(s) before the right clicked function or <i>Paste Function(s) After</i> to paste the copied function(s) after the
right clicked function.</p>

<p>Also the policy context menu (opened by a right-click on the
name of a policy) provides the menu item <i>Paste
Function(s).</i> Using this option adds the copied function(s) at the end of
the policy.</p>

<h4>Copying functions from one country to another</h4>

<p>Copying function(s) to another country is in principle not
different to the approach described above, however on
pasting the function(s), a dialog appears which allows the assignment of
systems. For a description of the dialog and its handling see <a
href="EM_WW_CopyingPolicies.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Copying policies</a>,
paragraph <i>Copying</i><i> policies from one country to another</i>.
Clicking <i>OK</i> adds the function(s) as
specified.</p>
