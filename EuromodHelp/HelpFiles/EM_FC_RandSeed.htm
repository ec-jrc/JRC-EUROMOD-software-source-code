<h1>The special function RandSeed</h1>

<p>RandSeed
sets the starting point for generating a series of pseudorandom numbers. In order to better understand how random numbers work in EUROMOD, 
you need to have an understanding of how random numbers work in computers in general.</p>

<p>Random numbers in computers are actually not random at all. Windows (as well as other Operating Systems) have a long list of pages with 
stored &quot;random&quot; numbers. The operating system keeps a pointer and each time you ask for a random number it returns the next in 
line, from the page it is currently reading. Changing the &quot;seed&quot; essentially means moving the pointer to a specific page and 
taking all the numbers there in order.</p>
 
<p>In practice, this means that if you set a specific &quot;randseed&quot; in the beginning of a system, you can be sure that you will get 
the exact same sequence of random numbers in every run. if you set the randseed with the same parameter in each system, then you can be sure 
that all systems get the same sequence of random numbers in every run. If you set the randseed with the same parameter every time before 
getting a random number, then you will always get the same &quot;random&quot; number.</p>

<p>Few more things to keep in mind are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any series of numbers you get after a randseed should be more or less equally distributed between 0 and 1. The more random numbers you 
	get after a single randseed, the better the distribution. If you set the randseed with every random number you ask for then there is no 
	distribution at all – you always get the same number.</li>
	<li>Randseed will definitely need to be part of your solution if you are using random numbers and want the results to be replicable (i.e. 
	if you need to get the same series of random numbers every time)</li>
	<li>If you set the same randseed and then give random numbers to the same individuals with the same order, then they will have the same 
	random numbers across systems. If however the number or order of individuals is changed, then there is no way to link random numbers to 
	individuals.</li>
</ul>

		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>


<p>In the example the variable stm01_s is filled for each individual with a random number between 0 and 1 (both included). 
Assuming both systems use the same data (i.e. the same number of individuals in the same order), you can be sure that 
for each individual variable stm01_s will have the same value in both systems. Note that, if RandSeed would not be used, 
or if the <i>Seed</i> was different, the program would produce different results for the systems sl_rand1 and sl_rand2.</p>
