<h1>Checking component use</h1>

<p>Selecting the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and pressing the button <i>Component Use</i> opens the <i>Component Use</i> dialog. This dialog allows for checking which &quot;components&quot; are used for the implementation of the country in EUROMOD. The following components can be included into the check:</p>

<h4>Included components</h4>

<p><strong>Variables:</strong> If this option is selected all EUROMOD variables, as listed in the variables file, are included into the check. As the checking for the use of all variables may cause that the check takes quite a lot of time, the variables can be restricted to those <i>having country specific description</i>. For closer information see <a href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD variables</a>. Moreover, the check-boxes <i>monetary</i>, <i>non-monetary</i>, <i>simulated</i> and <i>non-simulated</i> allow for further restriction to the variables which feature the respective characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Units:</strong> Selecting this option includes assessment units in the check (see <a href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - EUROMOD terminology</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Incomelists:</strong> Selecting this option includes incomelists in the check (see <a href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - EUROMOD terminology</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Queries:</strong></i> Selecting this option includes EUROMOD queries in the check (see <a href="EM_FC_Queries.htm">EUROMOD Functions - Queries</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Component named:</strong> This option allows for checking the use of a specific component, i.e. a specific variable, assessment unit, incomelist or query. Moreover, it allows for checking the use of variables and constants generated with the functions <a href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst.htm"><i>DefVar</i> and <i>DefConst</i></a> (which are not taken into account by the option <i>All Variables</i>).</p>

<p><strong>Ignore if Switched Off:</strong> Selecting this option means that components used only in switched off policies and functions are not recognised as used.</p>

<p><strong>Include Systems:</strong> The list allows to restrict the check for usage to the selected systems.</p>

<h4>Listing of used components</h4>

<p>Pressing the <i>Start</i> button starts the check. Once the check is finished, components as selected are listed if they are used in the implementation of the country. If a component is used several times, it is listed as often as it is used, each time with the respective location of use.</p>

<h4>Jumping to a component</h4>

<p>Selecting a specific use of a component and pressing the button <i>Goto</i> jumps to the selected use in the country's implementation. If the dialog is reopened (by pressing the button <i>Component Use</i>) it still shows the content of the last check, i.e. jumping to a component does not &quot;destroy&quot; the results of the check. The results of the last check are in general only cleared by a new check, but not for example by closing the dialog.</p>

<h4>Storing results</h4>

<p>Pressing the <i>Store</i> button allows for specifying a file where the current listing of component usage is stored in tabulated text format.</p>
