<h1>Administrating Variables</h1>

<p>The following operations are performed with the <strong>variable administration tool</strong>. To open this tool press the button <i>Variables</i> in the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> (also see <a href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD variables</a> paragraph <i>Administrating variables and acronyms in the EUROMOD user interface</i>).</p>

<h4>Adding variables</h4>

<p>Click the button <i>Add Variable</i> in the ribbon <i>Variables</i> of the variable administration tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Alt-V</i>. This adds an empty row to the list of variables. At first instance the row is added below the selected row. Note, however, that resorting the list (manually or by an automatic update due to another change) moves empty rows to the beginning (ascended sorting) or end (descended sorting) of the list of variables.</p>

<h4>Changing the name of a variable</h4>

<p>The name of a variable is changed by simply editing the respective cell.</p>

<p>If the name of an existing variable is edited, the acronyms currently used by this variable are highlighted in the list of acronyms. This indicates which acronyms can furthermore be used and which not. In this context, note that only acronyms of the same or a higher level as its precedent acronyms can be appended. See the <a href=https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resources/model-documentation>EUROMOD Modelling Conventions</a> for detailed information concerning the generation of variable names.</p>

<p>Once editing is finished, the interface checks the validity of the new name. Firstly, it checks whether the type and acronyms used exist. Secondly, it checks whether the order of acronyms is correct. Finally, it checks whether this name already exists. If any of the checks fails a respective warning is issued, but it is still possible to accomplish the change. The interface automatically updates the variable's description (<i>Automatic Label</i>). For unknown types or acronyms question marks are displayed.</p>

<p>Note that changing the name is only possible without warning, if the variable was added during the current session of the administration tool. For existing variables a message warns about possibly renaming a variable used in country implementations.</p>

<h4>Changing the monetary state of a variable</h4>

<p>To change the state of a variable from non-monetary to monetary or vice-versa, check respectively uncheck the box alongside the variable name.</p>

<h4>Changing the country specific descriptions of a variable</h4>

<p>If a variable is selected, the <i>Descriptions</i> list (located below the <i>Variables</i> list) shows country specific descriptions for this variable. These descriptions can be changed by simply editing the respective cells.</p>

<h4>Deleting variables</h4>

<p>Select the variable to delete and click the button <i>Delete Variable</i> in the ribbon <i>Variables</i> of the variable administration tool. Alternatively use the key combination <i>Ctrl-Shift-V</i>. A message is issued to warn about possibly deleting a variable used in country implementations. This warning is however not shown, if the variable was added in the current session of the administration tool (and therefore cannot be used yet).</p>

<h4>Filtering variables</h4>

<p>To obtain a better overview the variables listed can be reduced to those having certain properties (monetary / non-monetary, taken from data / generated by the model) and types (DEMOGRAPHIC, LABOUT MARKET, ..., UNKNOWN). Moreover, variables can be restricted to those having a country specific description (for a specific country or for any country). Select the respective properties and/or types and click the button <i>Apply Filters</i> to list the variables fulfilling the criteria.</p>

<p>The buttons <i>Select All Filters</i> and <i>Unselect All Filters</i> serve the easier selection of filters by generating an original state (all filters selected or no filters selected) that then can be refined as required.</p>

<h4>Sorting variables</h4>

<p>By clicking the header of the <i>Name</i> column variables are sorted by name. A second click changes the sorting direction (from ascending to descending and vice versa). Variables can also be sorted by <i>Automatic Label</i>, but the result will not differ much from sorting by name.</p>

<h4>Searching variables</h4>

<p>The <i>Search</i> button at the top right of the ribbon <i>Variables</i> allows for checking the existence of the variable as specified in the field above the button. Note that it is possible to use the search patterns <i>?</i> and <i>*</i>, where <i>?</i> stands for one arbitrary character and <i>*</i> for any number of arbitrary characters. The search will select the first visible match of the search pattern. If more than one occurrence is found or if the only occurrence is hidden due to filtering, an info box appears showing all the matches. Hidden matches will appear in dark grey colour. Visible matches will appear in black colour (blue when hovered) and clicking them will select the corresponding variable in the variables table. Also note that a full variable description tooltip appears if you hover the mouse over any of the matches.</p>
