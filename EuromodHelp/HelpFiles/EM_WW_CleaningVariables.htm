<h1>Cleaning variables</h1>

<p>To find out which EUROMOD variables and acronyms are not
used and therefore could potentially be deleted select the item <i>Clean Variables</i> from the variables
administration tool's menu (to open the variables administration tool press the
button <i>Variables</i> in the ribbon <i>Administration Tools</i> - also see <a
href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD
variables</a>).</p>

<p>Note that cleaning variables is only possible, if no changes
were accomplished in the current session of the variables administration tool,
otherwise the menu item is disabled. In this case close and open the tool
again, saving the changes if required.</p>

<p><strong><i>Loading not used
variables and acronyms</i>:</strong> Pressing the button <i>Load</i> starts the search for unused variables and acronyms. As this
may take a view minutes a progress bar is displayed.</p>

<p><strong><i>List of not used
variables</i>:</strong> The left part of the dialog shows the variables not used in
any country's implementation. Initially it is assumed that all listed variables
are to be removed. Uncheck any variables which should not be deleted.</p>

<p><strong><i>List of not used
acronyms</i>:</strong> The right part of the dialog shows the acronyms not used in
any variables' name. Note that acronyms used in a variable foreseen for removal
(i.e. checkbox ticked) may be listed as unused, if no other variable uses this
acronym. Again initially it is assumed that all listed acronyms are to be
removed. Uncheck any acronyms which should not be deleted.</p>

<p><strong><i>Performing the
cleaning process</i>:</strong> To accomplish the cleaning press the button <i>Clean</i>. Note that it is not possible to
undo the cleaning via the undo-functionality. However, there is no automatic
saving of the variables definitions file. That means closing the variables
administration tool without saving can still restore the old state.</p>
