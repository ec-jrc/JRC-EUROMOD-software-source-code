<h1>Generate a new EUROMOD project</h1>

<p>The item <i>New Project</i>
of the main menu <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title="">[1]</a> (which can also be found in the Version Control ribbon in the <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i> group)
opens a dialog which allows for generating a new EUROMOD project. For a
description of what a EUROMOD project is see <a href="EM_WW_AdminProjects.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD projects</a>.</p>

<p>The user interface requires the following information for
generating a EUROMOD project:</p>

<h4>Project Path and Project Name</h4>
<p>The <i>Project Path</i> is the path where the new project is to be stored. The user interface will
generate a folder using the name you provided in the <i>Project Name</i> field, containing the EUROMOD
file structure at the indicated path. Note that the folder named in <i>Project Path</i> must already
exist and that it must not contain a folder <i>Project Name</i> already. For more information on the
EUROMOD file structure see <a href="EM_FS_FileStructure.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture -
EUROMOD content (parameter files)</a>.</p>

<h4>Base Project</h4>
<p>In fact, a EUROMOD project will rarely be generated &quot;from scratch&quot;,
usually it will be a copy of an existing project, that then can be adapted.
Consequently, the generate-project-dialog allows for selecting this <i>Base Project</i>, with the following
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Project on
Disk</i>: With this option selected, the dialog allows for selecting (or typing)
the name of the folder, where the base project is stored <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Note that this will be the default choice if you are not logged into Version Control.</li>

<li><i>Project on
VC</i>: With this option selected, the dialog allows for selecting a base
project stored in the EUROMOD version control system. Once the option is
ticked, the combo-box alongside will list all the VC projects you have access to.<br>
Note however, that this option is only available if the user is connected to
the EUROMOD version control system (in which case, it is actually the pre-selected option). Consequently, if this is not (yet) the
case, clicking the option <i>Project on VC</i>
opens the version control login dialog, asking for a user name and password
(see <a href="EM_VC_LogInOut.htm">EUROMOD Version Control - Logging in and out</a>).
Also note that, when first ticking the option, it may take a short while, as
the available projects must be requested form the VC-system. For further
information on the EUROMOD VC-system see <a href="EM_VC_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD
Version Control</a>).</li>

<li><i>No Base Project</i>: As mentioned above,
projects will rarely be generated &quot;from scratch&quot;, but it is still
possible and enabled by selecting this option.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Content of the new project</h4>
<p>The button <i>Define Content</i> allows for
specifying which parts of the base project are overtaken into the new project.
Consequently, it is not available if the option <i>No Base Project</i> is selected. Moreover, an error message will be
displayed on clicking it, if no base project was selected yet.<br>
Otherwise clicking the button opens a dialog which lists all units (countries,
add-ons, config files etc.) of the base project. The user can then tick the
units she wants to overtake into the new project.</p>
