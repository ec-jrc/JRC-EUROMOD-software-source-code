<h1>Downloading a project bundle</h1>

<p>On regular basis, the EUROMOD team releases updates of the EUROMOD core project, 
which always include new or improved implementations of countries' tax-benefit systems, 
frequently new or improved implementations of EUROMOD add-ons and sometimes even new 
countries. This section describes how to download a given bundle, either as a clean 
new project or to update your existing local EUROMOD project. The following instructions
apply to any VC project, including the ones that you have created yourself.</p>

<h4>Creating a new local project</h4>
<p>In order to create a new (clean) local project out of an online bundle, you 
first need to click the <i>New Project</i> button to bring up the <i>New Project</i> form.
You can find this button in two places: in the main menu (white arrow in the upper left corner) and in the Version Control ribbon within the <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i> group.
There you should click on the checkbox <i>Project on VC</i>. Note that if you were 
not already logged into the VC, you will be asked to login now. Then you need to choose 
the Project and the Bundle you want to download. As with any new project,
you also need to specify the <i>Project Folder</i> and <i>Project Name</i> at
the top of the form. If you do not want to get the full bundle, you can specify which
units you want to download by clicking on the <i>Define Content</i> button.</p>

<p>So for example, if you want to create a new project out of the latest available 
master version, you need to:
<ul>
	<li>Click on <i>New Project</i> button to bring up the <i>New Project</i> form.</li>
	<li>Set the new project path and name.</li>
	<li>Check the <i>Project on VC</i> checkbox.</li>
	<li>Select the <i>EUROMOD_MASTER_VERSION</i> on the first combo-box.</li>
	<li>And finally click on OK.</li>
</ul>
The latest bundle will be selected by default, and all the available units will be 
included. Please note that it may take some time to download the whole project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if you want to create a new project for a specific paper that focuses for example on 
AT, BE, DE &amp; ES, and you want it based on master version H0.45, then you need to:
<ul>
	<li>Click on the <i>New Project</i> button to bring up the <i>New Project</i> form.</li>
	<li>Set the new project path and name.</li>
	<li>Check the <i>Project on VC</i> checkbox.</li>
	<li>Select the <i>EUROMOD_MASTER_VERSION</i> on the first combo-box.</li>
	<li>Select H0.45 on the second combo-box.</li>
	<li>Click on the <i>Define Content</i> button.</li>
	<li>In the <i>Define Project Content</i> form, chose only the units you want
	to download (AT, BE, DE, ES, all config files, possibly any Add-ons you need as well
	as the Input &amp; Log folders).</li>
	<li>Click OK on the <i>Define Project Content</i> form.</li>
	<li>And finally click OK on the <i>New Project</i> form.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Updating an existing local project</h4>
Sometimes however, you are already working with an existing local project and you need to bring it up-to-date 
with a given online bundle, but you want to do so without losing any of your local changes.
You can achieve this by following the steps below:
<ul>
	<li>Log into the VC, by clicking the <i>Click to Log In</i> button on the VC ribbon.</li>
	<li>Click on the <i>Compare and merge bundle</i> on the VC ribbon within the <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i> group to bring up the 
	<i>Version Control - Download Bundle</i> form. If you were already connected to a project, 
	it will be preselected in the <i>Project</i> combo-box.</li>
	<li>Select the Project and Bundle you want to download. At this point, VC will download detailed 
	information for each unit and compare them to your local units. This may take some time.</li>
	<li>Once done, the grid will be filled with detailed information. For each unit, you 
	will have the option to either keep your version, overwrite it with the online version, 
	or get merge support so that you can use the <i>Merge Tool</i> to combine the two 
	versions. Note however, that some options may not be available for all units. For example, 
	the Merge Tool does not support some unit types, so the <i>Get Merge Support</i> 
	option will be disabled. Also, if a local unit is already matching the contents of the 
	online unit, no further action can be taken.</li>
	<li>Click on the <i>Download</i> button. VC will not touch any units for which 
	you selected <i>Keep Local Version</i>, it will overwrite all units where you 
	selected <i>Get Online Version</i> and will create a merge environment for all 
	units where you selected <i>Get Merge Support</i>.</li>
	<li>If you selected <i>Get Merge Support</i> for one or more Countries or Add-ons, 
	you can now open them in the UI.  First you have to open the country, then click the <i>Compare & merge country/Add-on</i> button on 
	the VC ribbon and click <i>Yes</i> to open the Merge Tool using the downloaded 
	merging environment. For more information about merging see <a href="EM_VC_MergeTool.htm">The Merge Tool</a> section.</li>
	<li>If you selected <i>Get Merge Support</i> for the configuration files units, you can now click the <i>Compare & merge config files</i> button on 
	the VC ribbon and then click <i>Yes</i> to open the Merge Tool using the downloaded 
	merging environment.</li>
</ul>
