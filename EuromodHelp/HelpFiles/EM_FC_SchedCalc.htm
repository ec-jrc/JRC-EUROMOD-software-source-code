<h1>The policy function SchedCalc</h1>

<p>The function SchedCalc is a schedule calculator. Its basic functionality is demonstrated in example 1.</p>

<p>In the example the income defined by the incomelist il_taxableY
is divided into three bands, where the income band from annually 0 to 5,000
Euro (band_upLim, Grp/No 1) is taxed with a rate of
0% (band_rate, Grp/No 1), the income band from 5,000
to 50,000 Euro (band_upLim, GrpNo 2) with a rate of
25% (band2_rate, GrpNo 2) and all income above
50,000 Euro per year with a rate of 50% (band_rate, GrpNo 3).
An income of 60,000 Euro per year would for example lead to a tax of annually
16,250 Euro (5,000*0%+(50,000-5,000)*25%+(60,000-50,000)*50%)
and an income of 25,000 to a tax of 5,000 (5,000*0%+(25,000-5,000)*25%). You
may have noticed that there is no explicit definition of the lower limit of the
first band. This is not necessary, because it is by default zero. To change
this default the parameter band_lowLim, Grp/No 1 can
be used. There is also no explicit definition of the upper limit of the third
band, as by default the upper limit of the last band is infinite (actually
999,999,999.99). In fact the same schedule could be constructed by skipping the
0% band. Example 2 demonstrates how.</p>

<p>From a technical point of view it is possible to combine lower and upper
band limits, but if so this should be done with care, usually it is confusing.</p>

<p>Example 3 shows another option to use the function SchedCalc.
Instead of applying rates on the bands, fixed amounts are used.</p>

<p>For the income band from 5,000 (band_lowLim, Grp/No
1) to 50,000 (band_lowLim, GrpNo 2) an amount
of 500 (band_amount, Grp/No 1) is due and for all
income above 50,000 an amount of 1,000 (band_amount, GrpNo
2) is added. An income of 60,000 would for example lead to a tax of
1,500 and an income of 25,000 to a tax of 500. Obviously it is not possible to
define as well a rate as an amount for a single band. However, technically it
is possible to mix rates and amounts for different bands (e.g. define a rate
for band one and an amount for band two). Yet as it seems rather unlikely that
this is necessary, the programme issues a warning in such cases, assuming that
this was done by mistake.</p>

<p>The optional parameter quotient is relevant
for joint taxation: for couples the income of both partners is added and (in
the simplest case) divided by two, then the schedule is applied, to afterwards
multiply the resulting tax by two. With progressive tax-schedules this
procedure is of advantage for couples where one partner has low (or no) and the
other high income, as the average income falls into lower tax bands. Example 4
demonstrates a simple joint taxation schedule.</p>

<p>If the income of 60,000 is earned by a couple where one partner earns
50,000 and the other 10,000 the resulting tax is 12,500 (50,000 + 10,000 =
60,000; 60,000 / 2 = 30,000; (30,000 – 5,000) * 25% = 6,250; 6,250 * 2 =
12,500) when a quotient of 2 is applied, compared to 16,250 in example 1 (note
that the parameter TAX_UNIT is set to couple_sl in example4).</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, example 5 illustrates how to use the optional
and rarely used parameter simple_prog. If this
parameter is used, the same rate/amount is applied on all income. The
respective rate/amount is the one of the highest band the income falls into.</p>

<p>To use again the two examples with an income of 60,000 respectively
25,000: in the 60,000 case the tax amounts to 30,000 (60,000 * 50%), because
the highest band reached with this income is band two with a rate of 50%.
Accordingly, in the 25,000 case the tax is 6,250 (25,000 * 25%).</p>

<p>SchedCalc
provides two further optional parameters. The first, baseThreshold,
is a threshold for the base income. If the base income is below this threshold
the result(ing tax) is set to zero. The second, roundBase, allows rounding the
base income. By setting the parameter to 1 the base income is rounded to whole
numbers (e.g. 123.123 to 123 and 789.789 to 790). By setting it to 1,000 the
base income is rounded to whole thousands (e.g. 123,123.123 to 123,000 and
789,789.789 to 790,000). By setting it to 0.1 the base income is rounded to
have one decimal place (e.g. 123.123 to 123.1 and 789.789 to 789.8).</p>
