<h1>Adding Systems</h1>

<h4>Adding a system via copy/paste</h4>

<p>To add a system either click the <i>Add System</i> button in the ribbon <i>Country
Tools</i> or right-click on an existing system's header to select the menu item <i>Copy/Paste System</i> from the context menu.
This opens a dialog where you are asked to indicate the new system's name. Note
that the system's name must not contain any other characters than letters,
numbers and underscores. If any other character is used or if the chosen name
is equal to an existing system's name, an error message is issued, and you are
asked to change the name. Clicking <i>OK</i>
adds the new system.</p>

<p>Note that new EUROMOD systems are initially always a copy of
an existing system, as it is very likely that the new system can use an already
implemented system as template. For example, a country's 2012 system can be
based on the already implemented 2011 system, as well as a reform scenario is
usually based on an existing system. Such a template system is usually referred
to as the <i>base system</i>. If the new
country is added via the context menu of an existing system, the respective
system serves as the base system. If the new country is added via the <i>Add System</i> button one will be prompted a
dialog allowing for the selection of the base system.</p>

<p>The new system is initially nearly a true copy of the
existing system. That means amongst others that the new
system is automatically configured to run with all datasets the base system is
configured to run with. The only difference between the base systems and their
copies are the names of standard output files. If the base system, for example,
is called <i>sl_2010</i> it usually produces
a standard output file called <i>sl_2010_std.txt</i>.
For the derived system, called for example <i>sl_2010reform</i>,
this name is changed to <i>sl_2010reform_std.txt</i>.
For more information on standard output see <a href="EM_BC_InOut.htm">EUROMOD
Basic Concepts - EUROMOD input and output</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the user interface offers the possibility to
highlight the differences between a base and a derived system, using background
and/or text colour. If the base system highlights differences to its own base system,
it inherits this feature to the new system. Also other conditional formats are
overtaken from the base system. For more detailed information see <a
href="EM_WW_ConditionalFormatting.htm">Working with EUROMOD -
ConditionalFormatting.htm</a>.</p>

<h4>Adding the very first system</h4>

<p>The context menu, which is opened on clicking the <i>Policy column</i> offers the menu item <i>Insert First System</i>. This menu item is
disabled unless the country does not yet contain any system. Select the menu
item to open a dialog where you are asked to indicate the new system's name and
click <i>OK</i> to add the system. Note that
the same naming conventions are valid as explained above.</p>
