<h1>Workflow guide & basic concepts</h1>

<p>This section provides instructions for the most common workflows Version Control (VC) may be used for.
However, to better understand these workflows, you need to first understand the basic concepts of VC.</p>
<p> VC is an online repository for EUROMOD projects, that can store multiple versions of each project, 
allowing users to better track and manage their model's development. In these help pages, we refer to the 
projects stored in VC as <i>VC projects</i>. Every VC project is composed of several <i>Units</i>. A 
<i>Unit</i> can be a country, an Add-on, a configuration file (such as the Variables file or the Exchange 
Rates file), or a special folder (like the Log folder or the Input folder).</p>

<p>As already mentioned, VC can store multiple versions of each project. These versions are called <i>Bundles</i>. 


<p>The unit level is the finest level of control VC has. A user can download 
specific units only.</p>

<p>In the following pages, you will learn how to handle the most common workflows in VC:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href="EM_VC_WFI_DownloadingRelease.htm">Downloading a VC project bundle</a></li>
