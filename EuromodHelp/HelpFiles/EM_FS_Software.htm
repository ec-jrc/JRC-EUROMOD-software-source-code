<h1>EUROMOD software (user interface and executable)</h1>

<p>EUROMOD software essentially
consists of the EUROMOD user interface and the EUROMOD executable. Concerning
the tasks of these programmes please see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD
Installation and Architecture</a>. Moreover, EUROMOD software comprises some
additional programmes and files required by the model: most importantly the
programme that provides built-in help (EUROMODHelp.chm) and some configuration
files. All these parts are installed, respectively updated by the EUROMOD
installation programme (see <a href="EM_FS_InstallingEuromod.htm">EUROMOD
Installation and Architecture - Installing EUROMOD</a>).</p>

<p>Technically the user interface
is implemented using Microsoft Visual C# and requires a Microsoft Windows
environment. The executable is a C++ programme and, apart from some special
functions, can principally be compiled to run on other environments as well.
However, this option is currently not utilised nor are there plans to check it
out in the near future. Also in principle the executable can be run
independently from the user interface, by calling it from command line. See <a href="EM_FS_CommandLine.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD software (user interface and executable) – Command line parameters</a> for a detailed description on how to run EUROMOD executable from command line.</p>

<p>In fact, the communication between the user interface and
the executable takes place as follows:</p>

<p><strong><i>From
the user interface to the executable</i></strong>: The user interface launches the
executable and passes information via a configuration file. The most important information
passed is, where the EUROMOD content (i.e. XML parameter files) is stored and
which tax-benefit-systems are to be run. For a detailed description and the
storage place of the configuration file see <a
href="EM_FS_ConfigurationFile.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
software (user interface and executable) - The configuration file</a>.</p>

<p>Note that one run of the executable refers to one specific dataset.
That means, if users select several countries for run, respectively tax-benefit
systems of one country which are to be run with different datasets, the user
interface launches a corresponding number of instances of the executable with a
respective number of configuration files (compare <a href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>).</p>

<p><strong><i>From the executable to the user interface</i></strong>: The executable reports
about its progress via the standard output stream, whereas it writes errors and
warnings to the standard output stream for errors. The user interface keeps &quot;listening&quot;
to all instances of the executable it started by reading from these streams.
Thus the user interface is able to show progress and display error logs (compare
<a href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>).
Apart from reporting warnings and errors via the standard output stream for
errors, the executable generates a respective error-log-file to provide for
more permanent information.</p>
