<h1>Macrovalidation</h1>

<h4>What is the Macrovalidation tool?</h4>
<p>The tool computes aggregates and distributional indicators based on the EUROMOD output files the user selects, and compares them with external benchmarks. This can be done for both baselines and reform systems. Aggregated amounts are compared in terms of both number of people receiving a given income component and total yearly amounts. Market incomes, non-simulated taxes and benefits in the input dataset as well as simulated taxes and benefits are validated against external official data. External benchmark statistics are introduced in the External Statistics tables.</p>
<p>Like in the Statistics Presenter and the In-depth Plugin, the results will be shown on screen but can be exported to Excel as well. The tool is used to produce Validation Tables of EUROMOD Country Reports. </p>

<h4>Where can I find this?</h4>
<p>You can find Macrovalidation tool under the &quot;Applications&quot; toolbar ribbon.</p>

<h4>How to run the Macrovalidation tool?</h4>
<p>Select the output files you want to analyse. Note that you can select as many output files as you want, and they can be from baseline or reform systems, but they can only be from a single country at a time. As soon as you confirm your selection, the tool will compute all the aggregates and distributional indicators and compare them with SILC values and values introduced in the External Statistics tables.</p>


<h4>How to define External Statistics for the Macrovalidation tool?</h4>
<p>If you click on the External Statistics under the "Country Tools" toolbar ribbon, a dialog will open. It contains the following tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregates - Amounts. It shows all the components of all the income lists that are used to calculate disposable income (these variables are repeated in the next two tables). External statistics on revenue/expenditure have to be introduced for each concept, in millions of national currency. It also has a column for comments and another one to indicate the source of the information (these two columns are automatically copied in the next two tables).</li>
<li>Aggregates - Number of ben/taxpayers. External statistics on number of beneficiaries/taxpayers, which have to be introduced in thousands.</li>
<li>Aggregates - Level. For each concept the level of assessment of the statistics (individuals or households) should be indicated (individual is the default value).</li>
<li>Distributional - Inequality. External statistics on income inequality (figures from ESTAT used as default).</li>
<li>Distributional - Poverty. External statistics on poverty (figures from ESTAT used as default).</li>
</ul>
