<h1>Renaming a system</h1>

<p>To rename a system right-click the system's header to select the
menu item <i>Rename System</i> from the
context menu. This opens a dialog where you are asked to indicate the system's new
name. Note that the system's name must not contain any other characters than
letters, numbers and underscores. If any other character is used or if the
chosen name is equal to an existing system's name, an error message is issued,
and you are asked to change the name. Clicking <i>OK</i> renames the system.</p>

<p>If the system contains standard output policies (for example
the system <i>BG_2014</i> will usually
contain the output policy <i>output_std_bg</i> with the output file named <i>BG_2014_std</i>) you are asked whether the standard
output file(s) should be renamed. You can allow for this action or refuse.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you change the year of a systems (e.g. rename <i>BG_2014</i> to <i>BG_2015</i>) you are informed that <i>&quot;...
uprating-indices are now updated in accordance with your changes to system-year&quot;</i>.
You can refuse this action, but it is not recommended (see <a
href="EM_WW_DefiningUpratingFactors.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Defining
uprating factors</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, you are informed that <i>&quot;... Add-Ons are not adapted to reflect the new system name. Please
change policy <a href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">'AddOn_Applic</a>'
manually where necessary. &quot;</i>. You can avoid this warning for the next
time by ticking the option <i>Do</i><i> not reshow this
warning</i> (see <a href="EM_WW_Configuration.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Configuration</a>).</p>
