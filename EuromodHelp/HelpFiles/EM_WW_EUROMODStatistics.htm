<h1>EUROMOD Statistics</h1>

<p>EUROMOD has two tools to obtain summary statistics from ouput microdata: Statistics Presenter and In-depth Analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics Presenter</strong> provides descriptive statistics of income and population. It generates a set of <u>predefined</u> tables for budgetary and distributional impact.</p>
<p><strong>In-depth Analysis</strong> generates <u>customised</u> tables for budgetary and distributional impact of reforms. It is the advanced tool for analysis in EUROMOD.</p>
<p>Results of both tools are shown on screen and are also exportable to Excel.</p>


<h4>In-depth Analysis</h4>

<h5>What is the In-depth Analysis tool?</h5>
<p>The in-depth analysis tool allows producing customised tables for budgetary and distributional impact of reforms in three categories: Fiscal, Distributional, and Inequality & poverty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal category includes 4 tables containing the full disaggregation of taxes and benefits: totals and taxpayers/beneficiaries for each reform.</li>
<li>Distributional category includes 8 tables with totals, means, taxpayers/beneficiaries and winners/losers, by selected breakdown variable(s) and target population.</li>
<li>Inequality and poverty category includes 6 tables with several indicators of inequality, progressivity, redistribution and AROP rates and gaps.</li>
<li>Results are shown on screen and are also exportable to MS Excel. The tool allows full customization of output in terms of variables, level of analysis, target population and breakdown variables.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Where can I find this?</h5>
<p>You can find the in-depth analysis tool under the &quot;Applications&quot; toolbar ribbon.</p>

<h4>Statistics Presenter</h4>

<h5>What is the Statistics Presenter?</h5>
<p>The Statistics Presenter is an analysis tool that produces a fixed set of statistics based on EUROMOD output files. In particular, it offers aggregates for market incomes, taxes and benefits; distribution of income and demographic characteristics by deciles of equivalised disposable income; and inequality and at-risk-of-poverty indicators. It also provides aggregates and number of recipients/payers by decile for a variable specified by the user. The output tables are shown on screen, giving the user the possibility to save them in Excel format.</p>
