<h1>Summary of parameters for function DefInput</h1>
<p>Allows for readingvalues for one or more EUROMOD variables from a text file.</p>

<h4>Function Specific Parameters</h4>
<table class="info">
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Compulsory</th>
		<th>Unique</th>
		<th>Default</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>path</td>
		<td>text</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Path of the input file.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>file</td>
		<td>text</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Name of the input file.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RowMergeVar</td>
		<td>variable</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>ColMergeVar != n/a means 'lookup mode', i.e. one
		EUROMOD variable (per person) is set to a specific value looked up in the
		input file. The variable is defined by InputVar. Which value is looked up
		depends on the person's value of the variable defined by RowMergeVar as well
		as the person's value of the variable defined by ColMergeVar. The lookup
		value is the value of the cell whose row and column headers in the input file
		coincide with these variables.<br>
		<br>
		ColMergeVar = n/a means 'input mode', i.e. one or more EUROMOD variables
		(per person) are set to values defined in a specific row of the input file.
		The header row of the input file names the respective variables, while the
		other rows contain their values in the same order. One of these variables
		must be the variable defined by RowMergeVar. The row selected for a person is
		the one where the person's value of RowMergeVar coincides with the value of
		this variable in the input file. Note that, other than for the 'lookup mode',
		the RowMergeVar does not need to be located in the first column of the input
		file.<br><br>
		Note that the variables inputted in 'input mode' as well as the variable
		defined by InputVar must exist, i.e. be defined in the variables file or by
		EUROMOD functions (e.g. DefVar).</td>

		<td>DefaultIfNoMatch</td>
		<td>amount</td>
		<td>no</td>

		If not defined an error message is issued if no match can be established.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>IgnoreNRows</td>
		<td>amount</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>The first n rows of the input file are ignored (e.g. because they contain descriptions or headings).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IgnoreNCols</td>
		<td>amount</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>The first n columns of the input file are ignored (e.g. because they contain descriptions or headings).</td>

		<td>DecSepComma</td>
		<td>yes/no</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>no</td>

	<tr>
		<td>DoRanges</td>
		<td>yes/no</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>If set to yes, matches are established by considering RowMergeVar and ColMergeVar in the input file as upper limits.<br>
		Example: RowMergeVar dag in the input file set to 10, 30, 70, 150 <br>
		Interpretation:<br>
		all persons aged up to 10 (including) are assigned the value of the 10-column,<br>
		all persons aged older than 10 up to 30 are assigned the value of the 30-column,<br>
		all persons aged older than 30 up to 70 are assigned the value of the 70-column,<br>
		all persons aged older than 70 up to 150 are assigned the value of the 150-column,<br>
		no match is found for anyone older than 150.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RepByEMPath</td>
		<td>text</td>
		<td>no</td>
		<td>yes</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Any occurrences of RepByEMPath in parameter Path are replaced by the path
		of the current EUROMOD content (see <a href="EM_FS_HeaderPage.htm">EUROMOD Installation	and Architecture</a>).<br>
		Example: RepByEMPath = &amp;, Path = &amp;Tools\SomeFile.xls, EUROMOD content is stored at C:\EuromodFiles\ <br>
		Result: Path is interpreted as C:\EuromodFiles\Tools\SomeFile.xls.<br><br>
		Note that this parameter is only available under Windows as it uses platform specific functions.<br><br>
		Remark: Technically the programme obtains knowledge about the path of the
		EUROMOD content via the parameter EMCONTENTPATH in the configuration file
		(see <a href="EM_FS_ConfigurationFile.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD software (user interface and executable) - The configuration file</a>).</td>
