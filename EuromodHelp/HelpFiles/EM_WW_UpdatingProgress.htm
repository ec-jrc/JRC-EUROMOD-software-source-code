<h1>Obtaining information upon updating
progress</h1>

<p>The ribbon <i>Administration
Tools</i> provides a button <i>Updating
Progress</i>, which allows for opening a dialog that provides options to obtain
information upon the model's &quot;updating progress&quot;. That means EUROMOD
developers (and users) can assess which policy years are implemented for each
country and which datasets are available to run the respective systems.</p>

<p>The dialog is organised as a register with four tabs. The
first tab allows for controlling the information which is to be provided, while
the latter three display the respective information:</p>

<p><strong><i>Tab Settings</i></strong>: As mentioned above, this tab serves controlling
the information which is displayed in the other tabs. The list on the left hand
side allows for selecting the countries which are included, which buttons to
select <i>All</i> or <i>No</i> country. Clicking the
button <i>Generate</i> produces respectively
refreshes the information as described above for the selected countries. The
checkboxes on its left allow for including/excluding parts of the information. The box <i>Export to text
files</i> provides options for outputting the current content of the three
information tabs into text files. The field <i>Folder</i>
must indicate an output path where to store the resulting text files. The
folder can be selected with the button right of the field. The three fields below
must indicate the file names for storing the information. The checkboxes left
of them allow for including/excluding the respective tab.</p>

<p><strong><i>Tab Systems</i></strong>:
displays a table which lists the policy years (columns) which are implemented
for each country (rows). The crossing cell indicates whether the respective
system is &quot;available&quot;, i.e. presumably ready for use, &quot;private&quot;,
i.e. presumably not yet ready for use or not existing: &quot;-&quot;. These
policy year columns only display standard systems, i.e. systems following the
naming convention <i>cc_yyyy</i>. Other available
systems, which are not covered by this, are listed in the column <i>other</i>. If such a system is private, this
is indicated in brackets.</p>

<p><strong><i>Tab Datasets</i></strong>:
provides information on the available datasets for each country. The columns
display data years, which are extracted from the dataset name, i.e. if the
dataset's name is <i>cc_yyyy_xxx</i> (e.g. <i>be_2007_a3</i>, <i>uk_2009_lpc1</i>, etc.) the dataset is listed in the respective column.
The rest of the columns indicate the datasets' properties: i.e. their
collection and income year and whether they are private or not.</p>

<p><strong><i>Tab Combinations</i></strong>:
displays for each country the possible combinations of implemented systems and
available datasets, where the crossing cells indicate whether this combination
is only available (<i>x</i>) or a best match
(<i>best</i>). The information corresponds
to that shown in the data configuration dialog (see <a
href="EM_WW_ConfiguringDatasets.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Configuring datasets</a>)
and just allows getting information on several countries at once.</p>

<p>Note that the information to generate the tables is taken
from the indications as provided in the countries' configuration dialogs (see <a
href="EM_WW_SystemSettings.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Changing system settings</a>
and <a href="EM_WW_ConfiguringDatasets.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Configuring datasets</a>)
and is as accurate and up-to-date as this base.</p>
