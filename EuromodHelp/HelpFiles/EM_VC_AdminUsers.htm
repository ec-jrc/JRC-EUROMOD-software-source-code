<h1>Administrate Users</h1>

<p>Pressing the button <i>Administrate Users</i> in the <i>Version Control</i>
ribbon's section <i>NEW VC PROJECT</i> opens a dialog which allows for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding and removing users from the currently connected VC project</li>
	<li>Defining users' rights for the currently connected VC project</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that these
operations are only available to users which have administration rights for the
project (see below).</p>

<p>The main part of the dialog lists all users which are part of this VC project and for each of them their respective access rights <a href="#_ftn1" 
name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>

<h4>Add Users</h4>
<p>Pressing this
button opens a dialog showing all users which potentially can be added to the
project's VC. That means they are registered with the VC System but are not yet
users of the particular project. Ticking the respective users and pressing the
button <i>OK</i> adds the users to this VC project, which means
that they are now shown in the main-dialog's list of users. Initially the new
users have download rights. For information on how to grant them with other rights see <i>Defining users' rights</i> below.</p>

<h4>Remove Users</h4>
<p>Users are
removed from the project's VC by selecting them <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
and pressing the button <i>Remove Users</i>.
The dialog asks for confirmation of this operation to avoid unintended removal.</p>

<p>Note that the actual addition or removal of users from the project's VC actually only takes place
once the main-dialog is closed with <i>OK</i>.
If the dialog is closed with <i>Cancel</i>
no action takes place and thus all changes can still be undone.</p>

<h4>Defining users' rights</h4>

<p>A user can (or cannot) have the right to
perform three types of version control operations: downloading units from VC,
uploading units to VC and administrative operations. They are displayed and
manipulated via the list of users in the <i>Version Control - Administrate Users</i> dialog.</p>

<h6>Administration Right</h6>
<p>This checkbox defines whether the listed user may administrate the project
(ticked) or not (not ticked). Administration tasks are adding and removing
units to/from the project's VC and administrating users and their rights. </p>

<h6>Default Right</h6>
<p>This column takes the values <i>Download</i> or <i>Upload</i>. The right can be changed by selecting another value from the list.<p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Download</i>: This means that the user has the right to download units (e.g. countries). The user is however not allowed to upload any own versions to VC.</li>
	<li><i>Upload</i>: This means that the user has the right to download units and also to upload new versions.</li>
</ul>

The Version Control Administrator user is also added by default in all the projects, this user cannot be removed.</p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
The selection mechanism follows the usual Windows standards. That means that, to
selectseveral users, you can click on them while holding the <i>Ctrl</i>-key. Alternatively, click on the first user, press the shift key
and select the last user. Selected users are marked by blue background colour.</p>
