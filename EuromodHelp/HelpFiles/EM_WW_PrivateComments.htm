<h1>Private comments</h1>

<p>In addition to the comment, which is presented in the
rightmost column, it is possible to record &quot;private comments&quot;. Such
comments are private in the sense that they are not available in public
versions (see <a href="EM_WW_PublicVersion.htm">Working with EUROMOD –
Generating a EUROMOD public version</a>).</p>

<h4>Recording, changing and deleting private comments</h4>
<p>To record or change a private comment
right-click the <i>Comment</i> column of the
respective policy, function or parameter to open the context menu and select
the menu item <i>Private Comment</i> <a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. This opens an input box for editing the comment. The private comment is deleted
by clearing it in the input box.</p>

<h4>Display of private comments</h4>
<p>The existence of a private comment is indicated by a small
red rectangle in the comments cell. The respective text can be viewed (like a
tool tip) by moving the mouse over the cell.</p>

In fact the context menu can also be opened by clicking any other column except
the <i>Policy</i> column. (The policy
context menu does not provide the menu item to avoid further overload.)</p>
