<h1>Setting bookmarks</h1>

<h4>Setting a bookmark</h4>

<p>Select the row of the policy, function or parameter you want
to bookmark, select the ribbon <i>Display</i>
and click the button <i>Set
Bookmark</i>. Entering a name in the appearing dialog and confirming with <i>OK</i> adds the bookmark alongside the <i>Undo/Redo</i> buttons in the top left corner
of the user interface.</p>

<p>Moving the mouse over the bookmark shows its name. Moreover,
the symbol displayed indicates whether the bookmark refers to a policy (symbolised
by a blue ball), function (symbolised by the function symbol) or parameter (symbolised
by a star).</p>

<h4>Applying a
bookmark</h4>

<p>Clicking the bookmark sets the focus on the bookmarked row
and, if necessary, makes the row visible by expanding the policy/function it belongs
to.</p>

<h4>Removing a
bookmark</h4>

<p>Right click the bookmark you want to remove and select the
menu item <i>Remove from Quick Access
Toolbar</i>.</p>

<p>Note that bookmarks are personal settings, i.e. they are not
reflected in the country's parameter files and therefore not shared with other
users. This implies that saving has no effect on bookmarks and undo is not
available. Use the approach described above to remove bookmarks.</p>
