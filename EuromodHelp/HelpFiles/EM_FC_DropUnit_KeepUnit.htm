<h1>The special functions DropUnit and KeepUnit</h1>

<p>DropUnit
and KeepUnit allow for dropping individuals,
families or whole households with certain characteristics from the
calculations. For DropUnit
the parameter drop_cond
indicates a condition determining who is to be dropped, while for KeepUnit the parameter keep_cond describes who is to be kept, i.e.
those who do not fulfil the condition are dropped. The following examples show
some applications.</p>

	</tr>

<p>In example 1 all children younger than 15 are
dropped. Example 2 drops whole households (TAX_UNIT=household_sl), namely those in receipt of
pension. In example 3 only singles with positive employment income as well as
couples where both partners (keep_cond_who=all) have positive employment income
are kept. Note that only the couple (single) is kept, but not their children or
other relatives. Finally, example 4 shows a bit more complex use and
illustrates the application of different levels of assessment. The keep
condition defines persons aged between 15 and 65, who have positive earnings
and do not receive pensions. As a default (and as usual) the incomelists il_earns and il_pension would be assessed on TAX_UNIT level, therefore it is necessary to
use the level parameter to only take individual incomes into account. This is
not necessary for the personal variable dag, which is anyway (also as usual) assessed on
individual level. The parameter keep_cond_who tells that at least one person must fulfil the
condition for the household to be kept (it could in fact be omitted as one is the default and is only there to
make it explicit).</p>

<p>Usually the
dropping of units will take place at the very beginning of the spine, i.e.
before the respective tax-benefit calculations. However, in principle it can be
done anytime, as the &quot;time&quot; of dropping the units depends on when the
function appears in the policy/module order. Consequently all assessment units
built so far are deleted, as the program cannot rely that the persons forming
these constellations still exist.</p>
