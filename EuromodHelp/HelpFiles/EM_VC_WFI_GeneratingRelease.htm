<h1>Start/Finish Merging: Creation of a new online bundle</h1>

<p>If you are working on a given project and you have it on Version Control (VC), 
you will regularly find the need to save your work by uploading it to VC. You can 
do this by creating and uploading a new <i>Bundle</i>. This section describes how
to merge (upload) a new bundle in a VC project. Note that in order to do the following, 
you need to have 
the appropriate access rights to create a new bundle for this project.</p>

<p>Before starting the merge, please <b>open in EUROMOD the bundle where you implemented your changes</b> and log in to the Version Control.</p>

<p>Then, follow the steps under the <i>NEW ONLINE BUNDLE</i> group of 
the VC ribbon):</p>

<h4>1. Connect</h4>
<p>Open in EUROMOD the bundle where you implemented your changes.</p>

<h4>2. Start new online bundle</h4>

<p>Click on <i>Start new online bundle</i>: This button will lock the online bundle in order to prevent other users from changing it. If any other user tries to start a new online bundle for the same project, he/she will receive a message and will not be allowed to proceed.
After clicking on <i>Start new online bundle</i>, you will be asked to confirm this action. Click on <i>Yes</i>.</p>

 
<p>A message will confirm that a new online bundle has been started for that project. Click on <i>OK</i>.</p>

 
<p>All users with access to that project will receive an email in which they will be informed about the fact that you started a new bundle for that project.

</p>

<h4>3. Download latest bundle</h4>
<p>The latest online bundle should always be used as base for the new online bundle. This step will download the latest bundle and open it in EUROMOD 
so that it can be used as base project.
Click on <i>Download latest bundle</i> and fill in the form:

<ul>
<li>Select a path to store the project.</li>
<li>Select the components that you would like to download 
(Note: Switchablepolicyconfig, hicpconfig, input, varconfig, exchangerateconfig and em_log should always be downloaded in order to assure 
that the downloaded project works properly).</li>
<li>Click on <i>Download</i> .</li>
</ul>

 
After the online project has been downloaded, a message will appear. Click on <i>OK</i> .
 
This project will be automatically opened in EUROMOD. Another message will inform you about this, click again on <i>OK</i> .
</p>

<h4>4. Merge changes in countries</h4></p>
<p>This step will allow you to easily incorporate your changes to the country spines to the latest online bundle.</p>
<p>In order to do so, first you have to open the country you would like to merge. To do so, click on <i>Countries</i> and then, on the flag of the country:</p>
 
<p>Then, go back to the Version Control tool tab and click on <i>Merge country</i>. You will be asked if you would like to compare this bundle with another 
local bundle. That local bundle should correspond to the one from which you initiated the process (the one in which you implemented your changes). Click on <i>Yes</i>.</p>
 </p>
<p>The merge tool will be opened.
 
<p>The merge tool contains several tabs for the different elements that can be compared and merge. It is divided in
 two sections (local and remote). The area on the left-hand side displays the values in the local bundle (this is the one you have just downloaded). 
The area on the right-hand side displays the values in the remote bundle (this is the one from which you initiate the process, the one in which 
you implemented your changes).</p>
<p>Accept or reject your changes by right clicking on each change and then accepting or rejecting them. 
<ul>
<li><i>Accepting a change</i> means that this value will be copied from the remote bundle to the local bundle (this 
is, from the bundle where you implemented your changes to the bundle you just downloaded). </li>

<li><i>Rejecting a change</i> means that your modified value will be discarded and the original value will remain. </li>
</ul>
Once all changes have been accepted or rejected, click on <i>Apply</i>.A message will appear. Click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
 
<p>If needed, modify the country manually to add additional changes. Save your changes (Ctrl + S).</p>
<p>Repeat this step (step 4) for all the countries that you need to merge.</p>



<h4>5. Merge changes in configuration files</h4>
<p>This step will allow you to easily incorporate the changes you have performed to the configuration files to the latest online bundle.</p>
<p>Click on <i>Merge config files</i>. You will be asked if you would like to compare this bundle with another local bundle. 
That local bundle should correspond to the one from which you initiated the process (the one in which you implemented your changes). Click on <i>Yes</i>.</p>
 
<p>Select the configuration file that you would like to compare and click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
 
<p>The merge tool contains several tabs for the different elements that can be compared and merge. 
It is divided in two sections (local and remote). The area on the left-hand side displays the values in the local bundle 
(this is the one you have just downloaded). The area on the right-hand side displays the values in the remote bundle (this 
is the one from which you initiate the process, the one in which you implemented your changes).</p>
 
<p>Accept or reject your changes by right clicking on each change and then accepting or rejecting them. 
<ul>
<li><i>Accepting a change</i> means that this value will be copied from the remote bundle to the local bundle (this 
is, from the bundle where you implemented your changes to the bundle you just downloaded). </li>

<li><i>Rejecting a change</i> means that your modified value will be discarded and the original value will remain. </li>
</ul>


<p>Once all changes have been accepted or rejected, click on </i>Apply</i>. A message will appear. Click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
 
<p>If needed, modify the configuration file manually to add additional changes. Save your changes (Ctrl + S).</p>
<p>Repeat this step (step 5) for all configuration files (VARCONFIG.xml, EXCHANGERATESCONFIG.xml, HICPCONFIG.xml, SWITCHABLEPOLICYCONFIG.xml).
</p>

<h4>6. Update the log file</h4>
<p>From the Windows (or any operating system) file explorer, navigate to the path where you have downloaded the 
latest version of the model, access the Log folder and update the EM_LOG.xlsx file with the latest changes.</p>

<h4>7. Upload and finish online bundle</h4>
<p>After performing the previous steps (step 1-6), click on <i>Upload and finish online bundle</i>. You will be asked for confirmation, click on <i>Yes</i>.</p>
 
<p>Then, select the units that you would like to upload. 
The ones with changes will appear as modified. </p>
<p>The version may also be changed by ticking the checkbox <i>Manual Version</i> and then manually writing the new version. Click on <i>Upload</i>.</p>
 
<p>Wait until all units are uploaded. A message will appear then. Click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
 
<p>Once the new bundle is created, all users with permissions to access this project will receive an email 
informing them about the fact that a new bundle has been created by you for this project. </p>
<p>The online version of the project will also be unlocked once the new bundle is created so that other users can edit it if needed.</p>
</p>


<h1>Abort the creation of a new online bundle</h1>

<p>The creation of a new online bundle can be aborted at any time by clicking <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> on the <i>Abort new online bundle</i> button and then clicking on <i>Yes</i>.</p>
<p>Then click OK on the message that will appear.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>
The previous steps do not need to be performed at once. If you close EUROMOD in the middle of the process and then 
open it again later, EUROMOD will informed you about the fact that you have an unfinished merge when you connect to the same project again and 
you will be allowed to continue creating your online bundle from the same step you were performing when you closed EUROMOD.</p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
If you would like to continue a merge and you haven't downloaded the latest online bundle yet (you are still in step 1 or 2), 
you have to open EUROMOD with the bundle in which you implemented 
your changes and then connect to the project and continue the creation of the new bundle.</p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
If you would like to continue a merge and you have already downloaded the latest online bundle (you are in step 3 or later), you have to open EUROMOD with the bundle you have downloaded. After connecting to the project you will be asked if you would like to use the current bundle
as lastest online bundle. Click on <i>Yes</i> to continue from the same step you were performing when you closed EUROMOD. </p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>Please, notice that if you abort and then decide to create a new online bundle, you will have to start the process from the very beginning.</p>
