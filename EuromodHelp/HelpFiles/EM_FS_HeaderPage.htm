<h1>EUROMOD Installation and Architecture</h1>

<p>EUROMOD Architecture can be best described by dividing it
into &quot;software&quot; and &quot;content&quot;.</p>
<ul>
	<li>EUROMOD software basically comprises the EUROMOD
	user interface and the EUROMOD executable. For a detailed description see <a
	href="EM_FS_Software.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
	software (user interface and executable)</a>.</li>

	<li>EUROMOD content is a specific file structure.
	The structure is mainly composed by the EUROMOD parameter files, which
	essentially describe how the tax-benefit systems of the countries included in EUROMOD are implemented in the model. For a detailed
	description see <a href="EM_FS_FileStructure.htm">EUROMOD Installation and
	Architecture - EUROMOD content (parameter files)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When users launch EUROMOD they open in fact the EUROMOD user
interface which takes care of essentially the whole communication between users
and the model. The two main tasks of the user interface are to allow for</p>
<ul>
	<li>viewing and modifying the implementation of the tax-benefit systems of the counties included in EUROMOD</li>
	<li>running the model</li>
</ul>

<p>To accomplish the former task, the user interface reads
and modifies information stored in the EUROMOD content. Essentially it reads
from and writes to parameter files in XML format, which contain the
instructions the model needs for representing the countries’ tax-benefit
systems. To do so the user interface needs to know where to find the EUROMOD
content, that means it requires information where the respective files
structure is stored. This information is indicated and can be changed via the
main menu's item <i>Open project</i> (see <a
href="EM_WW_OpenProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Open project</a>). Note
that in principle it is possible that more than one EUROMOD content exists. In
other words there are two (or more) such file structures (which may contain
different versions of the parameter files). In this case the dialog can be used
to &quot;switch&quot; between these versions. Also note that it is possible to
simultaneously launch two (or more) instances of the user interface, which may
display different EUROMOD contents.</p>

<p>The user interface stores the EUROMOD content it points to
when it is closed and thus, on reopening, is able to display the same content.
Also with the installation of a more recent version of the software this
information will not get lost. Thus, only when EUROMOD is installed for the
very first time, the user interface does not have any information which content
to display and therefore opens the configuration dialog to allow users to
select a respective path. For more information see <a
href="EM_FS_InstallingEuromod.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture -
Installing EUROMOD</a>.</p>

<p>For accomplishing the latter task – running the model - the
user interface starts the EUROMOD executable, which in fact carries out the
tax-benefit calculations and produces the respective output in text format. To do
so the executable needs two sets of information. Firstly, it reads the XML
parameter files as stored in the EUROMOD content (and possibly modified by the
user interface). Secondly, it reads a configuration file produced by the user
interface for this specific run. Most importantly the configuration file tells
the executable which tax-benefit systems to run on which data.</p>
