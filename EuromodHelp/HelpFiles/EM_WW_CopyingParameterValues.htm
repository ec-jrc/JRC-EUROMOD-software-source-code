<title>Copying parameter values (and comments)</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Copying parameter values (and comments)</h1>

<p>There are several options to copy the values of one or more
parameters to other parameters. They are summarised below. Please note that these
options refer to the content of the parameter tree, i.e. they do not generate
new rows. You may want to check for options to copy whole sets of parameters in
<a href="EM_WW_CopyingPolicies.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Copying policies</a>
and <a href="EM_WW_CopyingFunctions.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Copying
functions</a>.</p>

<h4>Copying from and to
the clipboard</h4>

<p>This mechanism can be applied within a country and between
countries. Moreover, information can be transferred from and to
&quot;outside&quot;, e.g. Excel.</p>

<p>Please note that the mechanism works without restrictions
with the system columns (displaying parameter values and policy or function
switches <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>)
and the <i>Comment</i> column (displaying comments
to policies, functions or parameters). However there are certain restrictions
concerning the <i>Policy</i> and <i>Grp/No</i> column. While all cells of these
two columns can be copied and their values be transferred e.g. to Excel, not
all cells can be edited by pasting. The <i>Grp/No</i>
column is only editable for parameters, thus pasted values assigned to policy
or function rows are omitted. The edit ability of the <i>Policy</i> column is even more restricted, only a few specific cells
are editable, e.g. containing the components of incomelists (function <i><a href="EM_FC_DefIL.htm">DefIL</a></i>) or
the names of constants/variables (functions <i><a
href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst.htm">DefConst</a></i> and <i><a href="EM_FC_DefVar_DefConst">DefVar</a></i>). As for the<i> Grp/No</i> column, only those editable cells
can be changed by pasting.</p>
<ul type=none>
<li><strong>Selecting the copy region:</strong> Select the
region you want to copy by selecting the first cell of the region, and then
pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i> key
while selecting the last cell of the range. A darker blue colour shows the selection.
For a more detailed description of how to select cells see <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Selecting components and
values</a>. If no region is selected, the copy operation refers to the focused cell.</li>
<li><strong>Copying:</strong> Press <i>Ctrl-C</i> or <i>Ctrl-Insert</i> to
copy the selected region. Alternatively use the right mouse button to click
within the selection. This opens the context menu providing, amongst others,
the menu item <i>Copy Value(s)</i>.</li>

<li><strong>Selecting the paste region:</strong> Select the
top-left cell of the region where you want to paste the copied values. If you
want to restrict the paste operation to a certain region, select this region as
described above.</li>

<li><strong>Pasting:</strong> Press <i>Ctrl-V</i> or <i>Shift-Insert</i> to paste the content of the copied region to the
region selected for paste. Alternatively use the right mouse button to click
within the selection. This opens the context menu providing, amongst others,
the menu item <i>Paste Value(s)</i>.<br>
Please note that, if the copied region refers to one single cell, while the
paste region is a selection of several cells, all cells of the paste region are
filled by the value of the copied cell.<br>
Also note that it may happen that the copied region is too large or too small
(because the paste region is a selection as well or the cell selected for
starting the paste operation is too far to the bottom or right). In this case
only the cells for which there is a matching cell can be filled.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spreading parameters over systems</h4>
<p>A quite common task is to spread parameter
values from one system to (all) other systems. For example, if one implements a
new function, one will set the parameter values firstly in one system and then,
for a start, copy the values to all other systems to finally adapt the values
as required.</p>

<p>The user interface supports this task by the following
mechanism: Select the parameters you want to spread as described in <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Selecting components and
values</a>. For spreading a single parameter value just focus the respective
cell <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Pressing
<i>Alt-S</i> spreads the selected parameter
values to all other systems.</p>

<p>Note that parameters are only spread to visible rows and
columns (systems). This allows limiting the spreading to selected systems (see <a
href="EM_WW_ColumnChooser.htm">Working with EUROMOD - The column chooser</a>
for information on hiding systems). Moreover, be aware that functions of
collapsed policies as well as parameters of collapsed functions are not
involved in the spreading mechanism (see <a href="EM_WW_ExpandCollapse.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Expanding and collapsing policies and functions</a>). Also
hidden rows are excluded (see <a href="EM_WW_HidingRows.htm">Working with
EUROMOD - Hiding policies, functions and parameters</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, note that the mechanism checks the selection for
not exceeding the boundaries of a system. That means if parameters of several
systems are selected, pressing <i>Alt-S</i>
is ignored.</p>

<h4>Setting whole functions / policies to n/a</h4>
<p>There are two options to set the switch of
a policy or function to <i>n/a</i>: <i>n/a</i> and <i>n/a (all components)</i>. Selecting the former sets the respective
policy or function to <i>n/a</i>, whereas
the latter sets all functions and parameters contained in the policy,
respectively all parameters contained in the function, to <i>n/a</i> as well.</p>

Note that if the values pasted to policy or function switches are not switch
values (i.e. on, off, n/a) the user interface displays an empty cell,
however the pasted values are actually stored in the XML parameter file, thus
the executable will issue a respective error message (e.g. reporting that
'grumlmumpf' is not a valid switch). The same is true for any cell displaying a
drop down list when being edited (e.g. for the parameters <i>TAX_UNIT</i>, <i>who_must_be_elig</i>,
etc.).</p>


<p class="footnote"><a href="#_ftnref2"

The focused cell shows a red doted border. You focus the cell by e.g. clicking
into it. To close any possibly opening editor, use the Escape key.
Alternatively to the mouse you can use the arrow keys.</p>
