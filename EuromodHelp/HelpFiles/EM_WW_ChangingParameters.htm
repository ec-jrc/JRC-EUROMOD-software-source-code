<h1>Changing parameters</h1>

<p>In general parameter values can be changed by typing the new
value in the respective cell. However, depending on the parameter's value type,
the user interface provides different input assistance. The following
concentrates on this input assistance, for detailed information on parameters'
value types see <a href="EM_FC_ParameterTypes.htm">EUROMOD Functions - Types of
parameter values</a>.</p>

<h4>Editing categorical parameters</h4>

<p>For categorical parameters,
i.e. parameters, which take a certain limited choice of values, the user
interface provides lists from which the required value can be selected.
Examples are taxunit parameters (the user interface lists the available
assessment units), yes/no parameters (the user interface lists the values <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>), incomelist parameters (the user interface lists the available
incomelists), the parameter<i>
Who_Must_Be_Elig </i>(the user interface lists the values <i>nobody, one, one_adult, all, all_adults</i>), etc. Note that the lists
always contain the value <i>n/a</i>.</p>

<p>There are two ways of using these lists without applying the
mouse. The first is to type the initial letters of the required value, which
selects the first entry in the list that starts with these letters. For
example, if the list contains the values <i>tu_household_sl</i>,
<i>tu_individual_sl</i> and <i>tu_family_sl</i>, typing <i>tu_</i> (or <i>t</i> or <i>tu</i>) selects <i>tu_household_sl</i>, while typing <i>tu_i</i> selects <i>tu_individual_sl</i>. For the second way, firstly select the respective
cell (using the <i>Up, Down, Left, Right</i>
keys) and make it editable by pressing the <i>F2</i>
or the <i>Enter</i> key, then press the <i>Page Down</i> key. This opens the list. Use
the <i>Up, Down</i> keys to select a value
and confirm with the <i>Enter</i> or <i>Tab</i> key or close the list with the <i>Escape</i> key.</p>

<h4>Editing formula, condition and variable parameters</h4>

<p>For formula parameters, i.e.
parameters taking formulas like <i>yem*10%+ils_ben/2</i>,
condition parameters, i.e. parameters taking conditions like <i>IsDependentChild &amp; dag&lt;3</i> and
variable/incomelist parameters, i.e. parameters taking the names of variables and
incomelists, the user interface provides assistance in the form of so called
&quot;IntelliSense&quot;.</p>

<p>This mechanism
observes what the user types and makes &quot;suggestions&quot; within a small
window. For example, if the user is editing a formula parameter and typing an <i>i</i>, the mechanism
provides a list of operands, which are allowed in a formula (i.e. variables,
incomelists, queries, etc.) and start with an <i>i</i> (e.g. <i>idhh, idperson,
..., ils_earns, il_bsaBase, ..., IsMarried, IsParent, ...</i>). If the next
character typed is an <i>l</i>, the list is reduced to operands starting with <i>il</i>
and so on. Thus the user can either continue typing or accept a suggestion by
selecting it with the mouse. Alternative to the mouse the <i>Up, Down</i> keys
can be used for selecting and the <i>Tab</i> key for confirming the selection.
The <i>Enter</i> key also confirms a selection but at the same time stops
formula editing by moving the focus to the next row. Note that if the <i>Up,
Down</i> keys are used for selection, IntelliSense displays a short description
of the operand. Moreover, note that small icons help distinguishing the
operands by showing different pictures for variables, incomelists, queries,
etc.</p>

<p>Note that, if one
types the character 'q', IntelliSense lists all EUROMOD queries and thus provides an overview over all
available queries.

<h4>User interface's assistance in adding and using footnote parameters</h4>

<p>Some operands of formula and condition parameters allow for
so called footnote parameters. To learn more about this feature please consult <a
href="EM_FC_FootnoteParameters.htm">EUROMOD Functions - Footnote parameters for
the further specification of operands</a> and <a
href="EM_WW_ParameterPresentation.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Presentation of
(normal and) special parameters</a>. This section concentrates on the user
interface's support for generating such information.</p>

<p><strong>Generating footnote parameters:</strong> To equip an operand in a
formula with a <i>footnote</i>, type <i>#</i> after the operands name, e.g. <i>yem#</i>. Thereupon IntelliSense displays a list containing entries like <i>#x1[_LowLim],
#x2[_LowLim], #x3[_LowLim], ..., #x1[_Level] , #x2[_Level]</i> <i>...</i>. To
define for example a lower limit for the operand select <i>#x1[_LowLim]</i>,
which at first results in <i>yem#x1[_LowLim]</i>. However, once you complete
formula editing (e.g. by pressing the <i>Enter</i> key) <i>#x1[_LowLim]</i> is
replaced by <i>#1</i>. Moreover, the footnote parameter<i> #_LowLim</i>, with <i>Grp/No</i>
set to 1, is added. The only task left in finalising the definition of the
operand's lower limit is setting <i>#_LowLim's</i> value to the respective
amount.</p>

<p>To be precise, the
footnote number is not always set to 1, but to the next free number, i.e. if
the function already has footnote parameters with the numbers 1, 2 and 3, the
number of the new footnote parameter is set to 4.</p>

<p>The purpose of <i>#x2[_LowLim],
#x3[_LowLim]</i>, etc., as offered by IntelliSense, is to allow for generating
different lower limits within one formula editing procedure. You may for
example produce the following formula <i>yem#x1[_LowLim] + yse#x2[_LowLim] +
poa#x3[_LowLim]. </i>Once you complete formula editing the formula is adapted
to <i>yem#1 + yse#2 + poa#3</i> (provided the function did not yet contain any
footnote parameter). Moreover, three footnote parameters<i> #_LowLim</i>, with <i>Grp/No</i>
set to 1, 2 and 3, are added.</p>

<p>Note that it is also possible to generate footnote parameters by using
the <i>Add Parameter Form</i> (see <a
href="EM_WW_AddingParameters.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Adding parameters</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Assigning existing footnote parameters:</strong> The fact that footnote parameters can be
assigned to more than one operand, as well as the possibility to generate footnote parameters by using
the <i>Add Parameter Form</i>, opens the
questions how existing footnote
parameters can be assigned to an operand. To do so, again type <i>#</i> after the operands name, e.g. <i>yem#</i>. If there are existing footnote parameters, IntelliSense
displays them in the form <i>#_LowLim1</i>, <i>#_Level3</i>, etc. Selecting
e.g. <i>#_Level3</i> results in <i>yem#3</i> and thus the existing footnote parameter<i> #_</i>Level, with
<i>Grp/No</i> set to 3, is assigned to the
operand <i>yem</i>. Of course you can simply
type <i>yem#3</i> with the same effect, the
possibility of using IntelliSense for
this purpose is more or less just a reminder, that existing footnote parameters<i>
</i>can be reused.</p>

<p><strong>Generating #_amount parameters:</strong> <i>#_amount </i>parameters are in fact just special footnote parameters, whereupon the
speciality is based in the fact that the only operand they can be assigned to
is the operand <i>Amount</i>. Accordingly
they are generated as any other footnote
parameter with the difference that, instead of <i>operand#</i>, you must type <i>a</i>
(or <i>am</i>) to bring IntelliSense to list <i>Amount#x1</i>, <i>Amount#x2</i>
and <i>Amount#x3</i>. The rest of the procedure is as described above.</p>

<p><strong>Assigning existing #_amount parameters:</strong> Again there is no
difference to assigning other footnote
parameters, except that, instead of <i>operand#</i>,
you must type <i>a</i> (or <i>am</i>) to bring IntelliSense to list <i>Amount1</i>, ..., <i>Amount4711</i> etc.</p>

<h4>User interface's assistance in adding query parameters</h4>

<p>Some EUROMOD queries provide (optional or compulsory) query
parameters to specify their behaviour. These query parameters are very similar
to footnote parameters. Just like footnote parameters, query parameters start
with <i>#_</i> (e.g. <i>#_AgeMin</i>, <i>#_AgeMax</i>) and
they are assigned to the respective query by <i>#number</i>. To learn more about EUROMOD <i>queries</i> please consult <a href="EM_FC_Queries.htm">EUROMOD
Functions - Queries</a>. Again this section concentrates on the user
interface's support for generating query parameters.</p>

<p>IntelliSense lists queries with (optional or compulsory)
query parameters followed by <i>#x</i>, e.g.
<i>nPersInUnit#x</i>. Once formula editing
is completed <i>#x</i> is replaced by the
next free footnote number, e.g. <i>nPersInUnit#4</i>,
if the function already contains three <i>footnote
</i>or query parameters. Moreover, the respective query parameters are added, with <i>Grp/No</i> set to the free
footnote number. In our example the query
parameters<i> #_AgeMin</i> and <i>#_AgeMax</i> are added, with <i>Grp/No</i> set to 4 (for both).</p>

<p>If you want to
avoid the generation of query parameters, for example because the
parameters are optional and you do not want to define them, just delete the <i>#x</i> after the name of the query. This
informs the user interface that generating query parameters is unwanted.</p>

<h4>Replacing parameter names by their
'aliases'</h4>

<p>A left-click on a parameter name (in the <i>Policy</i> column) may show a dialog that
asks whether the parameter should be replaced by its 'alias'. The term 'alias'
refers to parameters, which replace each other, for example <i>Comp_perTU</i> / <i>Com_perElig</i> or <i>Output_Var</i>
/ <i>Output_Add_Var</i> (each also vice
versa). Confirming the question with <i>OK</i>
replaces the parameter's name respectively.</p>

<h4>Changing
the order of parameters</h4>

<p>There are two ways to change the order of parameters: by
using (a) drag and drop or (b) <i>control</i> + <i>Up/Down</i> keys. For each of them first
select the respective parameters. A single parameter is selected by simply
clicking it (more precisely, its name in the <i>Policy</i> column). A range of parameters is selected by selecting the
first parameter (i.e. its name in the <i>Policy</i>
column), then pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i>
key while selecting the last parameter. A darker blue colour shows the selection. For a more detailed description of how to select cells see <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Selecting components and
values</a>.</p>

<p>For (a) click the respective parameters with the left mouse
button, drag them with pressed mouse button to the new position and drop them
there by releasing the mouse button.</p>

<p>For (b) press the <i>Control</i>
as well as the <i>Up</i> key to move the
respective parameters up, respectively the <i>Control</i>
as well as the <i>Down</i> key to move them
down.</p>

<p>Note that parameters can only be shifted (up or down) within
the function they belong to. That means, this way it is not possible to move a
parameter from one function to another.</p>

<h4>Deleting
(ranges of) parameter values</h4>

<p>Note that this subsection describes how to delete parameter <i>values</i> and not how to delete parameters <i>as a whole</i>. For the latter please refer
to <a href="EM_WW_DeletingParameters.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Deleting
parameters</a>.</p>

<p>A parameter's value is 'deleted' if the <i>Delete</i>-key is pressed while the respective cell is selected.
'Delete' is put in quotation marks because in fact the value is not set to
empty but to <i>n/a</i> (not available or
not applicable). Note that this does not apply to parameter values in the
narrow sense only, but also to the switch of a policy or function.</p>

<p>It is also possible to delete (more precisely set to <i>n/a</i>) a range of parameter values by
selecting the respective range before pressing the <i>Delete</i>-key. A range of parameter values is selected by selecting
the first parameter value (i.e. the respective cell), then pressing and holding
the <i>Shift</i> key while selecting the
last parameter value. A darker blue colour shows the selection. For a more
detailed description of how to select cells see <a href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Selecting components and values</a>. Note that, in order to
delete parameter <i>values</i>, the <i>Policy</i> column must not be part of the
selection as this instructs the interface to delete the whole parameter.</p>

<h4>Automatic commenting of incomelist components</h4>

<p>The context menu for a <i>DefIl</i> function shows an additional menu item: <i>Description as Comment</i>. If the user selects this item, <i>tge</i> Comments column will be automatically filled with the description of all the components of the concerned incomelist. As an example, if an income list contains variables <i>yem</i> and <i>yse</i>, the Comments column will be filled, respectively, with income: employment and self employment. Note that country specific descriptions are used where available.</p>
