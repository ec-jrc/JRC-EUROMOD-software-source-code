<h1>Using the help system</h1>

<p>To access the user interface's help system press the <strong><i>F1
key</i></strong> or click the button <i>Help</i>

leads directly to the help page describing the part of the interface you are
working on or, if no specific help is available, to the help table of content.</p>

<p>Moreover, pressing the <strong><i>F5</i></strong> or <strong><i>F6 key</i></strong> in the main window of the user interface leads to an
explanation of the selected function (if any function is selected), where the <i>F5</i> key leads to a descriptive
explanation, usually with a couple of examples, whereas the <i>F6</i> key leads to a full (but brief)
description of the parameters of the function.</p>
