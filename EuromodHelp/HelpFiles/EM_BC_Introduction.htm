<h1>EUROMOD Basic Concepts</h1>

<h4>What is EUROMOD?</h4>

<p>EUROMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union that enables researchers and policy analysts to calculate, in a comparable manner, the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. Cross-country comparability is enabled by coding the policy systems of the EU Member States according to a common framework based on a standard set of <a href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2022-02/Modelling_Conventions_Y13_20220203.pdf" target="blank" >modelling conventions</a>. The EUROMOD platform is highly flexible but also organised, documented, validated and transparent. Underpinning the model is the purpose-built software comprising a user-friendly interface, supplemented by <a href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview/extended-functionalities" target="blank">extended functionalities</a> (plugins and add-ons) for special purpose analysis. The software is used in <a href="https://www.microsimulation.ac.uk/euromod/models/" target="blank"> many country-specific models</a> around the world.</p>

<p>Originally maintained, developed and managed by the <a href="https://www.microsimulation.ac.uk" target="_blank"><u>Institute for Social and Economic Research</u></a> (ISER) of the University of Essex, since 2021 EUROMOD is maintained, developed and managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, in collaboration with Eurostat and national teams from the EU countries. The model is <a href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/access-euromod" target="_blank">open source</a> since December 2020 (before December 2020 it was open access), with an increasing number of users across Europe and beyond. There are now several hundred active users from a range of institutional backgrounds, helping bridge the gap between academic research and policymaking.</p>

<p>For an overview of EUROMOD and its main features and uses, you can watch a couple of videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVBTX2dA0O4" target="blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3boUjcLaO0" target="blank">here</a>) recorded by ISER in 2019, before the full transfer of the model to the JRC.</p>

<h4>What can EUROMOD do?</h4>

<p>EUROMOD can be used in many different ways in different contexts. Examples include:</p>

<h5>Standard</h5>

<ul>
<li>Estimation of poverty, inequality and redistribution statistics under actual conditions, previous or future tax-benefit rules</li>

<li>Budgetary effects</li>

<li>Effects of simple tax-benefit policy reforms (or illustrative changes to household composition and original income)</li>

<li>&quot;Model family&quot; calculations</li>

<li>Indicators of work incentives</li>
</ul>
<h5>More advanced</h5>
<ul>
<li>Complex policy reforms (e.g. effects of revenue-neutral changes to tax rates and social insurance regulations)</li>

<li>Policy swapping between countries (i.e. effects on country A of adopting a policy measure currently effective in country B) Generation of budget sets as input to labour supply or other models of behaviour change Generation of counterfactual income to answer &quot;what if&quot; questions Assessing effects and costs of EU-wide policy reforms.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Data imputation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Generation of gross income (by source) from net, or vice versa</li>
</ul>
