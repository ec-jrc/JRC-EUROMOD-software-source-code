<h1>Logging in and out</h1>

<h4>Logging in</h4>

<p>If the user is currently not logged in, the login-button in the ribbon <i>Version Control</i> shows a door and
a green icon (and the text <i>Log In)</i>. Clicking
the button opens the login-dialog, which asks for a <i>User Name or Email address</i> and <i>Password</i>.
If these are correctly provided, the user is logged in, which is visualised by
the button now showing a door and a red symbol (and the text <i>Log Out</i>).</p>

<h6>Remember password</h6> If you tick this checkbox your password will be remembered by the application and you won't need to write it again.</p>

<h4>Logging out</h4>

<p>If the user is currently logged in, the login-button in the ribbon <i>Version Control</i> shows a door, a red icon and
the text <i>Log Out</i>. Clicking the button will log the user out, 
i.e. the button now shows a door and a green icon (and the text <i>Log In</i>). Moreover, all
other buttons (except for the Merge Tool) in the ribbon are deactivated, i.e. no version control operations
are available until the user logs back in.</p>
