<h1>Conditional Formatting</h1>

<p>To access the <i>Conditional
Formatting</i> dialog select the ribbon <i>Display</i>
and click the button <i>Conditional
Formatting</i>. The dialog supports two ways of conditional formatting:</p>

<h4>Conditional Formatting</h4>

<p>The upper part of the dialog allows for adding, removing and
setting the characteristics of conditional formats (in the following short CF).
CF's are formats, here text and background colour, which are applied to a
parameter value, if it fulfils the CF's condition.</p>

<p><strong>Adding a CF:</strong> Click the <i>Add</i> button (the button with the green plus) to add an undefined CF,
i.e. a row in the list of CFs.</p>

<p><strong>Removing a CF:</strong> Select the row of the CF and
click the <i>Delete</i> button (the button
with the red cross) to remove it from the list.</p>

<p><strong>The CF's condition</strong> defines the criteria the
parameter value must fulfil. It has the form &quot;<i>{pattern} OR {pattern} OR {pattern}</i>&quot; etc. That means, to
fulfil the condition, the parameter value must match one of the patterns
between the curly brackets, where a pattern consists of characters and the
wildcards * (for zero or more arbitrary characters) and ?
(for one arbitrary character). For example the
condition &quot;<i>{*#m*} OR {*#y*}</i>&quot;
is fulfilled by parameter values like &quot;<i>200<strong>#m</strong></i>&quot; or &quot;<i>50<strong>#y</strong>+yem*10%</i>&quot;. Please note that
the user interface tries to interpret the condition as far as possible and
ignores faulty parts. As an example, the faulty condition &quot;<i>{*#m*} OR {*#y*</i>&quot; would be
recognised as &quot;<i>{*#m*}</i>&quot;,
i.e. the second incorrect part is ignored (note the missing second curly
bracket).<i></i></p>

<p><strong>Systems to apply the CF on:</strong> The column <i>Systems to Apply</i> in the CF's row
indicates the systems the CF should be applied on. To change this setting,
click the respective cell with the left mouse button. In the appearing dialog
select the respective systems and press <i>OK</i>
to overtake them into the table.</p>

<p><strong>The CF's text and back colour:</strong> The columns <i>Back Color</i> and<i> Text Color</i> in
the CF's row define the respective colour settings of the CF. To change them,
click the respective cell with the left mouse button. In the appearing colour
dialog select the desired colour and press <i>OK</i>
to overtake it into the table. To set the colour back (i.e. use no special back
or text colour for the CF), right click the respective cell and select <i>Clear Color</i>.</p>

<h4>Differences to Base System Formatting</h4>

<p>The lower part of the dialog allows for highlighting
differences of a system's parameter values in comparison to the parameter
values of another system. It lists all available systems (in the column <i>System</i>) and, if available, the system to
compare with, i.e. the base systems (ergo listed in the column <i>Base System</i>). The base system is defined
by a click in the respective cell, which opens a dialog that allows for
selecting an appropriate system. A text and/or back colour can be defined to
accomplish the formatting, in the same way as described above for conditional
formatting. In order to maintain a certain consistency over countries, the
button <i>Restore Default Formatting</i>,
allows for setting the (back and text) colours for all system/base system pairs
back to a common default.</p>

<p>You also have the option to
expand any differences between a System and its Base System, by ticking the box
in the column <i>Expand Differences</i>.
This will make all differences &quot;immediately visible&quot; by expanding any
functions and policies that contain different values, and it is independent to
the formatting (colours) you applied.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use text colour formats for CF and back
colour formats for highlighting base system differences (or vice versa), if
applied on the same system, to avoid conflicting formats.</p>

<p>Click <i>OK</i> to confirm any changes or <i>Cancel</i>
to close the dialog without any consequences. Note that changes are only
definite once the country is saved. Before that you can still use the undo
functionality (see <a href="EM_WW_Undo.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Undo and
redo</a>) or close the country without saving.</p>

<h4>Automatically setting the Base System Formatting</h4>

<p>You can access this
functionality from the ribbon <i>Display</i>
by clicking the button <i>Automatic
Conditional Formatting</i>. This function will try to match all the Systems
according to their names and automatically select the appropriate Base System
for each one (but will only do so if a Base System does not already exist for
this System). For these Systems that it was able to find and assign a Base
System, it will also set the formatting to the Default colours. Note that this
function is only able to match standardized System names, such as &quot;<i>CC_YYYY</i>&quot; (where &quot;CC&quot; is
the short country code and &quot;YYYY&quot; is the 4-digit year) or &quot;<i>CC_YYYY_SomethingElse</i>&quot;
(where &quot;SomethingElse&quot; can be anything at
all). For the system DK_2012 the function will for example try to find Base
System DK_2011, for the system DK_2012_reform it will try to find Base System
DK_2012. If the function cannot find a match for a given System, then it will
not change anything.</p>
