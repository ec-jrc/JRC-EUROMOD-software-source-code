<h1>Deleting policies</h1>

<p>Policies can be deleted by either using the context menu or
via the <i>Delete</i>-key. In both cases
first select the policy/ies you want to delete. Then press the <i>Delete</i>-key. Alternatively right click
the name of (one of) the policy/ies for opening the context menu and selecting
the menu item <i>Delete Policy/ies</i>.</p>

<p>A single policy is selected by simply clicking it (more
precisely, its name in the <i>Policy</i>
column). A range of policies is selected by selecting the first policy (i.e.
its name in the <i>Policy</i> column), then
pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i> key
while selecting the last policy. A darker blue colour shows the selection.
For a more detailed description of how to select cells see <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Selecting components and
values</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection needs to include the policy column
(i.e. the name(s) of the policy/ies). If only system columns and/or the group
or comment columns are selected, the interface assumes that the respective <i>values</i> should be deleted - see <a
href="EM_WW_ChangingParameters.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Changing parameters</a>
(paragraph <i>Deleting (ranges of) parameter
values</i>). Moreover, when using the context menu you need to right click on the selection; otherwise you will be deleting the policy on which you right clicked, not the selection.</p>

<p>A security question is issued before the policies are
finally removed, which hints especially to the attempt of deleting compulsory
policies.</p>
