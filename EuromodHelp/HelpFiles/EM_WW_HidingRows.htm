<h1>Hiding & showing parts of the Spine</h1>

<h4>Hiding policies, functions and parameters</h4>

<p>The row context menu, opened by right clicking on the row
number, allows for hiding and unhiding (ranges of)
policies, functions and parameters.</p>

<h4>Hiding a single policy, function or parameter</h4>

<p>Right click on the number of the respective row and select the
menu item <i>Hide Row</i> from the row
context menu. For example, click row number 3 for hiding the 3rd policy in the
spine<i>;</i> row number 4.2.6 for hiding
the 6th parameter of the second function of the fourth policy in the spine,
etc. Alternatively select the row of the policy, function or parameter and
press <i>Alt-Shift-H</i>.</p>

<h4>Hiding multiple selected policies, functions or parameters</h4>

<p>First select a range of cells, then right click on <i>any</i> row number and select the
menu item <i>Hide Selected Rows</i> from the row
context menu. This will hide all the policy, function and parameter lines
that are currently selected. Note that if there is no current selection, then this
menu item will appear disabled.</p>

<h4>Hiding all but a single policy, function or parameter</h4>

<p>Right click on the number of the respective row and select the
menu item <i>Hide</i><i> all other Rows</i> from the row context
menu. For example, click row number 3 for hiding all policies except the 3rd
policy in the spine<i>;</i> row number 4.2.6
for hiding all parameters of the second function of the fourth policy in the
spine except the 6th, etc. Alternatively select the row of the policy, function
or parameter and press <i>Alt-O</i>.</p>

<h4>Hiding a range of policies, functions or parameters</h4>

<p>Right click on the first row of the range to open the row
context menu and move the mouse over the menu item <i>Hide Rows unto</i>. This opens a sub menu containing a combo box with a
list of row numbers. Select the last row of the range to hide all rows within
the range.</p>

<p>Note that the listed row numbers are limited to rows, which
firstly follow the first row of the range and secondly are on the same level as
the first row. For example, if row number 3 is selected as the first row, i.e.
the 3rd policy in the spine, the list of row numbers comprises 4, 5, 6, 7,
etc., i.e. all policies after the 3rd. Selecting 6 hides policies 3, 4, 5 and 6
and obviously also the included functions and parameters. If row number 4.2.6
is selected as the first row, i.e. the 6th parameter of the second function of
the fourth policy in the spine, the list of row numbers comprises 4.2.7, 4.2.8,
4.2.9, etc., i.e. all parameters after the 6th parameter of the second function
of the fourth policy. Selecting 4.2.8 hides parameters 4.2.6, 4.2.7 and 4.2.8.</p>

<h4>Hiding policies or functions that are "n/a" in all currently visible systems</h4>

<p>Right click on any row number and select the menu item <i>Hide all &quot;n/a&quot; Policy/Function rows</i>.
This will go through the whole spine and hide all policies and functions which are
set to "n/a" in all of the currently visible systems. Note that this only works for
policies and functions; it will not affect parameters even if they are set to &quot;n/a&quot;
for all visible systems.</p>

<h4>Hiding selected policies or functions that are "n/a" in all currently visible systems</h4>

<p>First select a range of cells, then right click on any row number and select the menu item <i>Hide selected &quot;n/a&quot; Policy/Function rows</i>.
This will go through the selected policies and functions and hide those which are
set to "n/a" in all of the currently visible systems. For example you may want to quickly
hide &quot;n/a&quot; functions within a given policy. In this case you would click on that
policy and then right click on its row number and select the <i>Hide selected &quot;n/a&quot;
Policy/Function rows</i> item. Note that this only works for policies and functions;
it will not affect parameters even if they are set to &quot;n/a&quot; for all visible systems.</p>

<h4>Unhiding policies, functions or parameters</h4>

<p>Right clicking any row and selecting the menu item <i>Unhide Rows</i> from the row context menu
opens a dialog that lists any hidden ranges of rows. Check the box of the range
you want to unhide and press the button <i>Unhide</i>. You can also use the "Check All" checkbox at
the bottom to quickly check/uncheck all the available ranges.
Note that nested hiding is not taken into account. For example, if you first
hide functions 3.2 to 3.6 and afterwards policies 2 to 4, the dialog only lists
policies 2 to 4 and unhides all functions and
parameters included.</p>
