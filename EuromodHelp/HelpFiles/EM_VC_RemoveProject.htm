<h1>Remove Project</h1>

<p>To remove a project from the version control system, press the <i>Remove VC Project</i> button 
in the <i>ADVANCED OPTIONS</i> group of the VC ribbon. Note that for this to work, you need to be already 
logged into Version Control and you need to have the required rights to remove projects. 
Pressing the <i>Remove VC Project</i> button opens the <i>Version Control - Remove Project</i> dialog.
This lists all projects currently available on the version control system.
By selecting a project and pressing <i>OK</i>
the respective project is <b>completely and irrevocably removed</b> from the version
control system.</p>

<p>Note that the operation does not affect the local project
(the project loaded by the user interface), even if this local project is
linked to the just removed remote project.</p>
