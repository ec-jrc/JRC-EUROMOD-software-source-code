<h1>Hypothetical Household tool (HHoT)</h1>

<h4>What is the Hypothetical Household tool (HHoT)?</h4>

<p>The Hypothetical Household Tool (HHoT) is a EUROMOD plugin for designing hypothetical households and generating data according to the chosen household characteristics. This hypothetical household data can then be used to estimate the effects of taxes and benefits on household disposable income, by normally running EUROMOD systems. </p>

<p>Traditionally, EUROMOD is used for analysing the distributive, labour market and budgetary impact of tax-benefit policies and policy changes. To do so, detailed and representative data on persons and households are required. With the HHoT plugin users can create their own hypothetical data, which allows them to better understand how policies work for households with specific characteristics, while giving them full control over the characteristics of interest (Gasior and Recchia 2019 <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>).</p>

<p>HHoT generates specified hypothetical household input datasets in the standard EUROMOD input data format, which can then be used with the EUROMOD software to perform tax and benefit microsimulations. The flexibility of the tool allows users to specify a broad spectrum of different hypothetical households. The specification of household composition and other characteristics is only limited by the scope of variables in EUROMOD input data. For example, three (or more) generation households can be included, as well as a variety of labour market statuses and income sources. HHoT allows users to compose, save, use and re-use their own database of hypothetical households.</p>

<p>More information about this plugin can be found in the "HHoT user manual", available in the EUROMOD website <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p>
