<h1>The special function ChangeSwitch</h1>

<p class="EM3only">This function is only available with EM3.</p>

<p>The function ChangeSwitch allows for changing the switches of policies or functions. 
Similar to the function <a href="EM_FC_ChangeParam.htm">ChangeParam</a>, ChangeSwitch is mainly used in add-ons.
(In fact, with the EM2 executable ChangeParam is also used to change switches.)</p>

<p>Different to ChangeParam, ChangeSwitch allows for a Run_Cond, which means, whether the switch-change is carried out or not, may be dependent on run-time conditions.</p>

<p>Note that (in contrast to changing switches with the EM2 executable) the original switch may be off. That means it is not necessary to use toggle anymore.</p>

<p>Also see <a href="EM_FC_Placeholders.htm">EUROMOD Functions – Identifiers and the placeholders =cc= and =sys=</a>.</p>
