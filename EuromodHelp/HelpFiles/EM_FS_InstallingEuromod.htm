<h1>Installing EUROMOD</h1>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 or later</li>

<li>Internet Explorer 9 or later (required to use the Statistics Presenter plugin)</li>

<li>Disk Space: 150 MB required to install the software, 850 MB required to unzip the model, and additional space for the input microdata</li>

<li>Internet connection (in case Microsoft .NET Framework is not installed yet)</li>

<li>Administrator permissions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Installation
or Upgrade of EUROMOD software </h4><p><i>see <a
href="EM_FS_Software.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
software (user interface and executable)</a></i></p>

<p>Download the EUROMOD software from the <a
href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/download-euromod">EUROMOD website</a>. Double click on the installer to launch the installation process and
follow the instructions. During installation, it will check and, if necessary, download and install
.NET Framework. It will also add a shortcut to the Start menu and to the desktop,
and add EUROMOD to the installed programmes in Windows Control Panel. Detailed instructions on how to install and configure EUROMOD software can be found in the corresponding <a
href="https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/EUROMOD%20installation%20and%20configuration%20manual.pdf">manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Specification the EUROMOD user interface's &quot;references&quot;</h4>

<p>Setup automatically starts the EUROMOD user interface. Upon
the first installation of the interface, it opens the open-project-dialog,
which allows for selecting the project (i.e. the specific versions of country-implementations)
the user interface refers to (see <a href="EM_WW_OpenProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Open project</a>, in particular
paragraph <i>Opening the user interface for
the very first time</i>).</p>

<p>You may also want to configure other important settings, as
for example where the model, as a default, generates output or where the model,
as a default, looks for input data. This purpose is served by the project configuration
dialog, opened via the item <i>Project Configuration</i>
of the main menu <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. See
<a href="EM_WW_Configuration.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Configure project</a>
for a detailed description.</p>

<p><strong>The user interface
maintains these specifications. Thus, on a subsequent start of the user
interface, and also on a subsequent installation, it does not request this
information anymore.</strong></p>
