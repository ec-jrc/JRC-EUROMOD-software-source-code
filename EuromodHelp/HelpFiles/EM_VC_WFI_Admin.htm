<h1>Administrating VC projects</h1>

<p>From time to time, you will have a specific research project to complete that 
requires you to create a separate EUROMOD project. For example, you may need to
write a comparative paper for 10 countries. For cases like these, you can create
and manage your own custom VC projects and this section shows you how to do this.</p>

<h4>Create new VC project</h4>

<p>Creating a new empty VC project is very easy and can be completed in three simple steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="EM_VC_LogInOut.htm"><i>Log in</i></a></li>
	<li>Click the <a href="EM_VC_AddProject.htm"><i>Add VC Project</i></a> button</li>
	<li>Select a name for this project and click OK</li>
</ul>
<p>The above steps will generate a new empty VC project and connect your local project to the 
new VC project.</p>

<h4>Administrating the content of your VC project</h4>

<p>Once your new VC project is ready and you are connected to it, you will need to add some 
content (units) to it. You can do this by clicking the <i>Administrate Content</i>
button in the <i>ADMIN</i> section of the VC ribbon to bring up the <a href="EM_VC_AdminContent.htm">
<i>Version Control - Administrate Content</i></a> form. This form contains a listbox with 
all the available version controlled units for the VC project you are connected to. Using
the buttons at the bottom of the form, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add Local Units to VC: which allows you to upload your existing local units into the VC project.</li>
	<li>Remove Units from VC: which will remove the selected units from VC.</li>
	<li>Get Units from VC: which will create a local copy of the selected VC units (taking the latest version available).</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming this is a new VC project you just created, you would need to click the <i>Add 
Local Units to VC</i> button and select the units you want to include in the VC project. Note that this
will automatically generate a bundle for your project, you can select the version number by ticking the checkbox <i>Manual Version</i> and inserting
the version number.</p>

<h4>Administrating the Users of your VC project</h4>

<p>So now you have a VC project that is ready to be used. The next step will be to allow
other people to use it. When you create a new VC project, you are automatically added as
the administrator of this project. To add or remove other users, or to change their access
rights, you need to click the <i>Administrate Users</i> button, which will bring up the
<a href="EM_VC_AdminUsers.htm"><i>Version Control - Administrate Project Users</i></a> form. Here you will
see a list of all existing users, along with their access rights for this project. You can 
add further users by clicking on the <i>Add Users</i> button on the top right. This will
give you a list of all the VC users (who are not already part of this project) and allow 
you to give them access to this project <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. 
Furthermore, you can finetune the type of access each user has. 
The highest access a user can have is to be an <i>Admin</i> for this project, meaning 
that (s)he has the power to change everything related to this project or even to remove 
this project from VC completely. The <i>Default Right</i> is the right that the user has for all units:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Upload</i>: means the user can see, upload & download all units in that project.</li>
	<li><i>Download</i>: means the user can see & download all units in that project.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Removing a VC project</h4>

<p>If you are an <i>Admin</i> for a VC project, then you are also able to completely 
remove it from Version Control. You can do this by clicking the <i>Remove VC Project</i>
button to bring up the <a href="EM_VC_RemoveProject.htm"><i>Version Control - Remove 
Project</i></a> form. Then you can simply select the project you want to remove and 
click <i>OK</i>. After confirming your choice, the VC project you selected will be 
removed.</p>

If the user you would like to add is not in that list, then you need to contact 
the VC responsible in the core EUROMOD team so that (s)he can add this user to 
the Version Control platform.</p>
