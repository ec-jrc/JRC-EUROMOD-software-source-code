<h1>EUROMOD terminology</h1>

<p>The following index provides a brief description of some
important EUROMOD specific terms and concepts.</p>

<h4><a name="TM_BestMatch"></a><a name="TM_System"></a>EUROMOD system</h4>

<p>The term system refers to the rules necessary to simulate a
particular tax-benefit system. It may refer to an existing tax-benefit system
(e.g. the DK tax-benefit rules for 2020) or to a reform scenario.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Parameters"></a>EUROMOD parameters</h5>

<p>EUROMOD parameters contain the information the model needs
to produce its output. Essentially they describe the tax-benefit systems of the
implemented countries. They are stored in XML files (two for each country).
Moreover, there are some common XML files, storing for example information
about <a href="#TM_Variables">EUROMOD variables</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Spine"></a>EUROMOD spine</h5>

<p>EUROMOD spine is a term describing the list of taxes and
benefits calculated by EUROMOD and the order in which they are processed.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Taxunit"></a>EUROMOD assessment unit (tax unit)</h5>

<p>The implementation of countries' tax-benefit systems usually
requires assessment units. The smallest EUROMOD assessment unit comprises a
single individual while the largest comprises the whole household. Some policy
instruments, e.g. child benefits, require something in between, e.g. a family
definition. EUROMOD assessment units also contain definitions of e.g. who is a
dependent child, who is the head of the unit, etc. In EUROMOD lingo assessment
units are frequently (and sloppily) referred to as tax units.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Incomelist"></a>EUROMOD incomelist</h5>

<p>EUROMOD incomelists are
definitions of income concepts (e.g. disposable income) used within the
tax-benefit system of a particular country. Technically an incomelist
is the aggregate of several <a href="#TM_Variables">EUROMOD variables</a> and
possibly other incomelists. These components (in rare
cases fractions or multiples of them) are either added or subtracted to build
the aggregate. The term &quot;income&quot; list
indicates that the most common applications of the concept are income concepts,
for example disposable income, taxable income, ... </p>

<h5><a name="TM_Policy"></a>EUROMOD policy</h5>

<p>EUROMOD polices describe the implementation of particular
taxes (contributions) or benefits of a country. Usually there is one policy for
each tax or benefit. Polices are composed of <a href="#TM_Function">EUROMOD
functions</a>. Apart from polices describing taxes and benefits, there are
special polices, which define for example <a href="#TM_Taxunit">assessment
units</a>, <a href="#TM_Incomelist">incomelists</a>
or the content of <a href="#TM_Output">output</a> files.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Function"></a>EUROMOD function</h5>

<p><a href="#TM_Policy">EUROMOD
policies</a> are broken up into EUROMOD functions, which represent a
particular component of the policy. As a (typical) example, a benefit policy
may consist of a function that determines eligibility for the benefit and a
function that calculates the benefit amount for all eligible units. The purpose
of using functions as building blocks of the model is to provide a general
structure, which can be seen as using a standardised language to describe policy
instruments.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_Output"></a>Standard output</h5>

<p>As a default EUROMOD produces an output text files for each
simulated <a href="#TM_System">system</a>. This standard output file contains
one row for each person listed in the input data, comprising some identification
and demographic variables taken from the input data, as well as variables and <a
href="#TM_Incomelist">incomelists</a> calculated by
the model, most essentially <a href="#TM_DisposableIncome">EUROMOD standard
disposable income</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="TM_DisposableIncome"></a>EUROMOD standard disposable income</h5>

<p>In general the following components make up disposable
income in EUROMOD (for each country and <a href="#TM_System">system</a>):
original income (essentially employment and self-employment income; capital,
property and investment income; private pensions and transfers) plus benefits
(cash transfers, essentially unemployment benefits, public pensions, family
benefits, social transfers, other (country specific) cash transfers) minus
direct taxes (essentially income tax, capital tax, other (country specific)
direct taxes) minus social insurance contributions. As this income concept is
standardised as far as possible over the countries implemented in the model it
is referred to as standard disposable income (and defined in the <a
href="#TM_Incomelist">incomelist</a> ils_dispy).</p>

<h4><a name="TM_Variables"></a>EUROMOD variables</h4>

<p>EUROMOD knows four types of variables: 1) variables
contained in input data, 2) variables simulated by the model (marked with the
postfix _s), 3) intermediate variables and 4) special purpose internal
variables. Variables of type 1 and 2 are described in a special EUROMOD
parameter file, the variable description file. Variables of type 3 are defined
by using special EUROMOD functions (DefConst, DefVar). Variables of type 4 are produces internally by the
model to fulfil specific functionalities, an example
is the loop counter of the EUROMOD looping functions (<a href="EM_FC_Loop_UnitLoop.htm">Loop</a>,
<a href="EM_FC_Loop_UnitLoop.htm">UnitLoop</a>).</p>

<h5>Best match</h5>

<p>The term best match describes an optimal <a href="#TM_System">system</a>-dataset
combination, as there is sometimes more than one possibility to simulate a <a
href="#TM_System">system</a>. For example, if the Belgian 2006 <a
href="#TM_System">system</a> can be simulated either by using data with income
year 2005 or data with income year 2006, the combination 2006 <a
href="#TM_System">system</a> / 2006 dataset constitutes the best match. EUROMOD
good practise however suggest setting the best match flag only for baselines,
which are explained in the next paragraph.</p>

<h5>Baseline</h5>

<p>Baseline is usually the term used for a <a href="#TM_System">system</a>-dataset
combination, which fulfils the best match criterion as described above. In
addition however, the system must refer to an actual policy year and the <a
href="#TM_System">system</a>-dataset combination must be the main or default
implementation for the respective policy year. To understand this, assume a
country for which three implementations for the policy year 2013 exist: (A) is
using SILC data with income year 2013, (B) is using a national data source,
also with income year 2013, while (C) is using the same data as (A), i.e. SILC
data, but implements a reform scenario. Though each of the three <a
href="#TM_System">systems</a> is in line with the description of &quot;best
match&quot;, i.e. all use data with 2013 income, only (A) is called a baseline:
(B) does not fulfil baseline criteria as it is not using the standard EUROMOD
data source and (C) is not referring to an actual policy year. It must however
be mentioned, that the term baseline is not a very clear definition, thus it
could for example be used for (B) if a reform scenario exists, which also uses
the national data source, in order to denote that (B) is the base scenario for
the reform.</p>

<p>What concerns good practise in labelling a <a
href="#TM_System">system</a>-dataset combination as best match, only (A) should
be labelled as such. Doing so allows for distinguishing between the EUROMOD
core implementation and other developments. In the example, (B) does not belong
to the core as it is a special development for a certain country, where some
alternative data source can be used (for whatever reason). (C) is a reform
scenario and therefore obviously not part of the core.</p>
