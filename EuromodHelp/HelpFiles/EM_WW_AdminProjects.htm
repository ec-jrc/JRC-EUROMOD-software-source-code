<h1>Administration of EUROMOD projects</h1>

<p>A EUROMOD project is actually not much more than a notation of a
folder containing the EUROMOD file structure (see <a
href="EM_FS_FileStructure.htm">EUROMOD Installation and Architecture - EUROMOD
content (parameter files)</a>). In fact, the user interface always points to
such a folder and its main task is to allow for visualising, administrating and
editing its content. In other words the user interface always refers to a
concrete EUROMOD project.</p>

<p>In practical terms this
means that a user can easily switch from one project to another. For example
she can have one project containing the &quot;EUROMOD
core project&quot;, i.e. the one she gets from the EUROMOD team. Then she may
have a project where she implements changes for the purpose of analysing
certain policy changes. Then she may have another project where she implements
changes for the purpose of analysing other policy changes, etc. Switching
between the projects is accomplished via the item <i>Open Project</i> of the main menu.

See <a href="EM_WW_OpenProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of
EUROMOD projects - Open project</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The user also may want to
generate a new project. This is described under <a href="EM_WW_NewProject.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD projects - New project</a>.</p>

<p>Except from describing a
certain EUROMOD file structure, a project also has some (project specific)
features. For example, it may have a specific <i>Input Folder</i>, meaning that it points to other datasets as e.g. the
EUROMOD core project. Another quite important feature is whether a project is
version-controlled or not. See <a href="EM_WW_Configuration.htm">Working with
EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD projects - Configure project</a> for
further information.</p>
