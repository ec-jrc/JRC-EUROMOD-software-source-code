<h1>Configuring datasets</h1>

<p>To view or change the settings of the datasets that can be
used to simulate the country's tax-benefit systems select the ribbon <i>Country Tools</i> and click the button <i>Databases</i> in the <i>Configuration</i> group. This opens the <i>Configure Databases</i> dialog.</p>

<h4>Assigning datasets to systems</h4>

<p>The upper part of the dialog shows a table where the row
headers list all datasets available for the country, while the column headers
list all available systems. The intersection of a dataset (row) and system
(column) indicates whether the system can be run with the dataset, in other
words whether they form a so-called system-dataset combination (see <a
href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic Concepts - Terminology</a> and <a
href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a> for more
information).</p>

<p>There are three possible settings. A cross (x) indicates
that the dataset and the system form a system-dataset combination. <i>Best</i> also denotes a system-dataset
combination, however in addition this combination is a <i>Best Match</i> (see <a href="EM_BC_Terminology.htm">EUROMOD Basic
Concepts - Terminology</a>). <i>n/a</i>
means that the system cannot be run with the dataset.</p>

<p>Note that, if a system is copied (see <a
href="EM_WW_AddingSystems.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Adding systems</a>), the
datasets assigned to the original system are automatically also assigned to the
copied system. Use the <i>Configure
Databases</i> dialog to change this, if necessary.</p>

<p>A right click in the datasets table opens a context menu, which allows for more convenient assigning of datasets to systems, by allowing to set the same value (x, or n/a) for all system-dataset combinations of a specific system or a specific dataset.</p>

<h4>Adding removing or renaming a dataset</h4>

<p>To add a dataset click the <i>Add Dataset</i> button, which opens a file search dialog allowing for
the search of a text file containing data suitable to run (one or more of) the
country's systems.</p>

<p>To delete a dataset, select it and click the <i>Delete Dataset</i> button. Note that the
dataset is removed without any further warning, but you can still undo this
action by closing the dialog with the <i>Cancel</i>
button. Of course the dataset (text file) is not
deleted physically, the removal concerns only the ability to use the dataset
with the country's systems.</p>

<p>To rename a dataset, select it and click the <i>Rename Dataset</i> button. This opens a
textbox, which allows for entering the new name.</p>

<h4>The settings of the selected dataset</h4>

<p>Below the <i>Datasets / Systems</i> table the dialog shows the settings of the selected dataset.</p>

<p><strong><i>Collection Year</i></strong>: This
setting indicates the year the data were collected.</p>

<p><strong><i>Income Year</i></strong>: This
setting indicates the year the monetary values within the data refer to.</p>

<p><strong><i>Currency</i></strong>: This
setting indicates in which currency data are stored. Possible values are <i>euro</i> or <i>national</i> (standing for national currencies like Danish
Krone, Polish Zloty, Bulgarian Lev, etc.).</p>

<p><strong><i>Decimal Sign</i></strong>: This
setting indicates whether data uses point (.) as decimal sign or comma (,).</p>

<p><strong><i>Path</i></strong>: This setting
indicates a specific path to locate the dataset. Usually it is left empty, to
instruct EUROMOD to locate the dataset at the default path (see <a
href="EM_WW_OpenProject.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Open project</a>).</p>

<p><strong><i>Private</i></strong>: This
setting, if checked, indicates that the dataset is not (yet) ready to be
presented to the public. In practise the only impact of the setting concerns
the generation of a EUROMOD public version, see <a
href="EM_WW_PublicVersion.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Generating a EUROMOD
public version</a>.</p>

<p><strong><i>Use Common Default</i></strong>:
Checking this option means that any variable not existent in data, but used by
the system, is set to zero, i.e. no error message is issued. In this context
also consider the role of the function<i> <a
href="EM_FC_SetDefault.htm">SetDefault</a></i>.</p>

<p><strong><i>Read Expenditure-related Variables</i></strong>:
Checking this option will cause all expenditure-related variables to be automatically imported from the data. These variables can then 	be used within the model exactly as if they were defined one by one in the variables file. The definitions of expenditure-related variables are as follows:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><i>Expenditure variables</i>: all variables whose name starts with "x" followed by numbers only; imported as monetary variables</li>
<li><i>Quantity variables</i>: all variables whose name starts with "q" followed by numbers only; imported as non-monetary variables</li>
<li><i>Price variables</i>: all variables whose name starts with "p" followed by numbers only; imported as monetary variables</li>
</ul>
<p><i>String Output Variables</i>:
This setting indicates a list of variables, separated by space, which exists in the described data and are to be transferred to output.<br>
The values of the variables may be alpha-numeric (i.e. contain strings).<br>
Note that a warning is issued if the variables are not found. Moreover, note that the name is not case-sensitive.
</p>

<p><i>Ind. Tax Table Year</i>: See <i><a href="EM_WW_DefiningIndirectTaxes.htm">Defining Indirect Tax Rates and Excises Prices</a></i> for the usage of this value.</p>

<p><i>Read Expenditure-related Variables</i>:
Checking this option means that the programme reads all expenditure-related variables,
where expenditure-related means that the name of the variable must start with x (for expenditure), p (for price), q (for quantity) or xs (for share of income).
All other characters must be digits (0 to 9).<br>
These variables are then disposable, independent on whether they are declared in the variables file or not.
That means amongst others that they are covered by using e.g. VarGroup=x* in the DefOutput function (independent on whether they are used elsewhere).

<p>Click <i>OK</i> to
confirm any changes or <i>Cancel</i> to
close the dialog without any consequences. Note that changes are only definite
once the country is saved. Before that you can still use the undo functionality
(see <a href="EM_WW_Undo.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Undo and redo</a>) or
close the country without saving.</p>
