<h1>Configuration dialog</h1>

<p>The
configuration dialog, which is opened by selecting the main menu's item <i>Project configuration</i>, offers options to
configure the project currently loaded by the user interface. There are four
tabs, which provide the following options.</p>

<h4>Tab General</h4>

<h5>Output Folder</h5>
<p>This setting instructs EUROMOD
to generate, as a default, any output at the indicated path. Type the
respective path into the field or select it with the folder search dialog
opened by the button alongside the field. Note that this default output path can
still be changed for a particular run in the respective field of the run dialog
(see <a href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>
paragraph <i>Selecting the output path</i>).</p>

<h5>Input Folder</h5>
<p>This setting instructs EUROMOD
to look, as a default, for input data at the indicated path. Type the
respective path into the field or select it with the folder search dialog
opened by the button alongside the field. Note that this default input path can
still be changed for a particular dataset in the <i>Configure Databases</i> dialog (see <a
href="EM_WW_ConfiguringDatasets.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Configuring
datasets</a>).</p>

<h5>Set Standard Input/Output-Paths</h5>
<p>Pressing this
button sets the <i>Output Folder</i> to <i><strong>Project Path</strong>\Output</i> and the <i>Input Folder</i> to <i><strong>Project Path</strong>\Input</i>.</p>

<h5>Store View Settings</h5>
<p>EUROMOD saves the view settings if this option is ticked. </p>


<h5>Close User Interface with Last Country</h5>

<p>If this option is ticked the user interface is closed, once
the last country (and add-on) is closed. If the option is not ticked, the user
interface is not closed in this case, but displays the EUROMOD logo (as it does
when it is opened and no country is yet loaded).</p>

<h4>Tab Version Control</h4>

<h5>Is Version Controlled</h5>

<p>If this option is checked, the user is automatically
connected to version control when the project is loaded, provided that the
project is version controlled. For further information see <a
href="EM_VC_LogInOut.htm">EUROMOD Version Control - Logging in and out</a>.</p>

<h4>Tab Auto save</h4>

<p>This tab allows for defining the auto-saving interval, or to
dis/enable auto-saving. For further info see <a href="EM_WW_Saving.htm">Working
with EUROMOD - Changing countries' tax-benefit-systems - Saving, saving as and auto-saving</a>, paragraph <i>Auto-saving</i>.</p>

<h4>Tab Warnings</h4>

<p>The user interface issues at appropriate points
warnings with the option &quot;Do not reshow this warning&quot;. If the
respective box is checked this type of warning is not reshown, even if the
interface is closed and opened again. The tab <i>Warnings</i> allows for defining which types of warnings should be
displayed.</p>
