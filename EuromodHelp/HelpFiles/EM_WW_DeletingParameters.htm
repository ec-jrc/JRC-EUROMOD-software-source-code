<h1>Deleting parameters</h1>

<p>Parameters can be deleted by either using the context menu
or via the <i>Delete</i>-key. In both cases
first select the parameter(s) you want to delete. Then press the <i>Delete</i>-key. Alternatively right click the
name of (one of) the parameter(s) for opening the context menu and selecting
the menu item <i>Delete Parameter(s)</i>.</p>

<p>A single parameter is selected by simply clicking it (more
precisely, its name in the <i>Policy</i>
column). A range of parameters is selected by selecting the first parameter
(i.e. its name in the <i>Policy</i> column),
then pressing and holding the <i>Shift</i>
key while selecting the last parameter. A darker blue colour shows the selection. For a more detailed description of how to select cells see <a
href="EM_WW_Selecting.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Selecting components and
values</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection needs to include the <i>Policy</i> column (i.e. the name(s) of the
parameter(s)). If only system columns and/or the group or comment columns are
selected, the interface assumes that the respective values should be deleted -
see <a href="EM_WW_ChangingParameters.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Changing
parameters</a> (paragraph <i>Deleting
(ranges of) parameter values</i>). Moreover, when using the context menu you need to right click on the selection; otherwise you will be deleting the parameter on which you right clicked, not the selection. In addition note that with the context menu it is only possible to delete
parameters belonging to one function - use the <i>Delete</i>-key if you want to delete a wider range of components.</p>

<p>A security question is issued before the parameters are
finally removed. Note that you can opt to not show the security query anymore -
see <a href="EM_WW_ManagingWarnings.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Managing
warnings</a>.</p>
