<h1>The EUROMOD user interface</h1>

<p>The EUROMOD user interface is the central accession point of the model. Its purpose is to help users to orientate themselves within the options provided by the model and around the model.</p>

<p>The user interface's main window shows the following components:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Countries </i></strong>is filled with flags for the implemented countries. The flags can be clicked to access the EUROMOD parameters of the respective country. EUROMOD parameters store the information the model needs for its calculations. How the user interface presents this information is explained in <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">Presentation of countries' tax-benefit-systems</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>The button<i> Run EUROMOD</i></strong> left of the ribbon <i>Countries</i> opens the EUROMOD <i>run dialog</i>, which is explained in <a href="EM_WW_RunDialog.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Running EUROMOD</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Display</i></strong> provides different tools to facilitate the visualization of the spine. These dialogs allow for:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>displaying a single policy or the full spine,</li>
		<li>highlighting with colours (see section <a href="EM_WW_ConditionalFormatting.htm">Working with EUROMOD -	Formatting</a>),</li>
		<li>setting bookmarks, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Country Tools</i></strong> enables access to a number of dialogs, which support working with a country's parameters. These dialogs allow for:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>configuring country settings (e.g. name, short name), system settings (e.g. currency, exchange rate to Euro) and the input datasets which can be used for simulating the country's tax benefit system (see section <a href="EM_WW_ConfiguringDatasets.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Changing Countries' Settings</a>),</li>
		<li>offer a number of search tools, which - besides allowing for standard searching and replacing - facilitate finding errors and assessing if and where certain EUROMOD components (e.g. variables) are used in the respective country's parameters (see section <a	href="EM_WW_SearchReplace.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Searching</a>),</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>The ribbon<i> Administration Tools</i></strong> enables	access to dialogs which allow for:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>adding and deleting of countries and Add-Ons (see <a href="EM_WW_AddingCountries.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Adding countries</a>
			and <a href="EM_WW_DeletingCountries.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Deleting	countries</a>),</li>
		<li>administrating EUROMOD's variables, global extensions, HICP and exchange rates. (see <a href="EM_WW_Variables.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Administration of EUROMOD variables</a>),</li>
		<li>generating EUROMOD public versions (see <a href="EM_WW_PublicVersion.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Generating a EUROMOD public version</a>).</li>
	</ul>

	<li><strong>The ribbon <i>Add-Ons</i></strong> is filled with icons for the available EUROMOD add-ons. The icons can be clicked to access the implementation of the respective add-on. The presentation of add-on implementations is equal to the presentation of country  implementations and can therefore be looked up in <a href="EM_BC_PresentationTaxBen.htm">Presentation of countries' tax-benefit-systems</a>. For more information on add-ons and an example see <a href="EM_FC_AddOn_Applic_AddOn_Pol_AddOn_Func_AddOn_Par.htm">EUROMOD Functions - EUROMOD add-ons and the	special functions AddOn_Applic, AddOn_Pol,AddOn_Func and AddOnPar</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>The ribbon <i>Applications</i></strong> enables access to a number of tools, which allow for analysing the EUROMOD output, respectively preparing the EUROMOD input (see section <a href="EM_WW_Applications.htm">Working with EUROMOD - Applications</a>). They comprise tools for:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Generating simple summary statistics</li>
		<li>Generating hypothetical input data</li>
		<li>Generating the macrovalidation tables</li>
		<li>Generating in-depth analysis summary statistics</li> 
		<li>Generating policy effects analysis</li>
		<li>Opening output file</li>

	</ul>
	<li><strong>The ribbon <i>Help & Info</i></strong> provides help and relevant information such as the EUROMOD version in use, and the End-User Licence Agreement. </li>
	<li><strong>The main menu</strong> left of the <i>Run EUROMOD</i> button contains functionalities like saving countries' parameters, opening projects, changing configuration, as well as exiting the programme. These functionalities are described at appropriate points in the section <a href="EM_WW_HeaderPage.htm">Working with EUROMOD</a>.</li>
</ul>
