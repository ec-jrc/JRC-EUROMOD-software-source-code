    <h4>Selecting baselines and reforms</h4>
    <p>
        The file selection dialogue contains basic error-checking to ensure that the selected baselines & reforms properly match each other.
        There should be one and only one baseline per country, and at least one reform. If the files are not properly matching,
        an error message is displayed when clicking OK and the dialogue is not closed.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Note: The paths for selecting the baseline and reform folders, also support file filtering with the use of the "*" and "?" characters. The ".txt" part is automatically added to the filter.
