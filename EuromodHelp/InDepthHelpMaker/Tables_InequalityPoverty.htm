    <h1>Inequality and poverty Tables</h1>

    <h4>General arguments</h4>

    <h6>Poverty lines</h6>
    <p>
        For Tables <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_33.htm">3.3. AROP rates</a>, <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_34.htm">3.4. AROP gap</a>,
        <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_35.htm">3.5. AROP rates by type</a> and <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_36.htm">3.6. AROP gap by type</a>
        users can define poverty lines by specifying two attributes:
        <ul style="margin-top:0">
            <li><b>type</b> and</li>
            <li>depending on type, either <b>percentage</b> or <b>monthly amount</b></li>
        </ul>
        Users can select one of 3 <b>types</b>:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>
                <b>relative anchored:</b>
                poverty line is calculated as a percentage (e.g. 60%) of the individual median of equivalised income in the <b>baseline scenario</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>relative floating:</b>
                poverty line is calculated as a percentage (e.g. 60%) of the individual median of equivalised income in the <b>respective scenario</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>absolute (monthly):</b>
                poverty line is indicated as a monthly amount
            </li>
        </ul>
        Income is defined in the respective application and equivalised using the modified OECD equivalence scale.
    </p>

    <h6>Household type breakdown</h6>
    <p>
        For Tables <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_35.htm">3.5. AROP rates by type</a> and <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_36.htm">3.6. AROP gap by type</a>
        users can define the household type over which the Tables are broken down.<br />
        For this purpose they must indicate a variable that exists in the baseline output file and provides a restricted number of values.<br />
        For example, the variable:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>
                <i>dlg</i> (large family) will generate one row for households considered as large families (dlg=1) and one for the other households (dlg=0)
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>dms</i> (martial status) will generate one row for each type of martial status (single, married, divorced, ...) of
                <b><span style="color:darksalmon">the first person in household</span></b> (in the output file)
            </li>
        </ul>
        Note that the variable <b><span style="color:darksalmon">must not be monetary</span></b>, because monetary variables are summed over household members.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default there are four breakdowns: <strong>Standard_Labour_Categories</strong>,<strong>Standard_HH_Categories</strong>,<strong>Standard_Gender_Categories</strong>,<strong>Standard_Age_Categories</strong	>.
		For more details on the default breakdowns see the <a href="Settings_Breakdowns.htm">Default Breakdowns</a> page.
	</p>
	<p>
		The user can remove the default breakdowns and/or add as many new ones they want. To add back a default breakdown, just use its name instead of a variable.
    </p>

    <h6>Income definitions</h6>
    <p>
        For Tables <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_31.htm">3.1. Inequality</a>, <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_33.htm">3.3. AROP rates</a> and
        <a href="Tables_InequalityPoverty_34.htm">3.4. AROP gap</a> users can define income definitions, which reflect the path from original income to disposable income.
        For this purpose, they define:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>a variable or formula for original income</li>
            <li>
                a list of variables or formulas which define &lsquo;<i>add to previous</i>&rsquo; values,<br />
                where the first is &lsquo;added&rsquo; to original income, the second is &lsquo;added&rsquo; to this first, etc.<br />
                In the end original income plus all &lsquo;<i>add to previous</i>&rsquo; should yield disposable income.<br />
                &lsquo;Add to previous&rsquo; is in quotation marks because, in fact, users must define whether the value is added or subtracted by starting
                the formula with <b><span style="color:darksalmon">+</span></b> respectively <b><span style="color:darksalmon">-</span></b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In addition, users can define captions for original income, for each of the originating intermediate incomes and for disposable income.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default the following list is displayed:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>caption</b></td>
                <td><b>variable/formula</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A = original income</td>
                <td>ils_origy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B = A - taxes and social insurance contributions (EQ_INC23)</td>
                <td>- ils_tax - ils_sicdy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>C = B + pensions (EQ_INC22)</td>
                <td>+ ils_pen</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>D = C + other benefits (disposable income, EQ_INC20)</td>
                <td>+ ils_benmt + ils_bennt</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
