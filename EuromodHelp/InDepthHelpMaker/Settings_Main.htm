    <h1>Main settings</h1>

    <h4>EUROMOD project folder</h4>
    <p>
        This input box allows for defining the path of a EUROMOD project. By default, this is the currently loaded project.<br />
        The tool will try to load the information required for the analysis from this EUROMOD project.
        Most importantly this concerns the composition of income lists which is used for displaying the decomposition of revenue and expenditure variables/formulas in the Fiscal Tables.<br />
        When baselines and reforms are loaded (see <i>Select baselines and reforms</i> below) the tool will check whether the respective output files were
        generated with the indicated EUROMOD project, by using the EUROMOD log file if it exists, and issue a warning if not.
        The tool will still try to extract the required information by matching the filename to a country/system within the selected project. If retrieving the info is not possible (if
        for example there is no country or system that seems to correspond with an output file), the tool will, apart from issuing a warning, not display any
        decomposition of revenue and expenditure variables/formulas in the Fiscal Tables.
    </p>

    <h4>Selecting baselines &amp; reforms</h4>
    <p>
        Clicking the button <i>Select baselines &amp; reforms</i> opens a special <a href="Settings_BaselinesReforms.htm">file-selection dialogue</a>
        that allows for selecting the  baseline and reform output files used for the analysis.
        If the selection is successful, the files are shown in the two tables above the button.<br />
        The upper table shows information about the selected baselines. Usually there will be one baseline, but as the tool allows for multi country mode,
        more than one baselines may be shown, with the restriction that there cannot be more than one baseline per country.<br />
        The lower table shows information about the selected reforms. There should be one or more reforms per baseline.<br />
        The columns of the tables show the following information:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>The first column shows a check or x, depending on whether the file exists and is usable.</li>
            <li>The second column shows the name of the output file. Moving the mouse over this name shows a tooltip with the path of the output file.</li>
            <li>
                The third column allows for defining a custom label for this baseline/reform, that will be used in the generated Tables.
                If the label is left empty, the system name will be used by default.
                If the system has a standard name, e.g. MT_2020_std, a &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; version is displayed, e.g. Malta 2020.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Note that the selected baselines and reforms are remembered for the duration of the EUROMOD session,
        but not saved in the settings (see <i>Administrate settings</i> below).<br />
    </p>

    <h4>Selecting Pages/Tables for calculation</h4>
    <p>
        The table on the right side of the dialogue lists all the Tables that can be generated by the tool. The list is grouped into three categories:
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>Fiscal</li>
            <li>Distributional</li>
            <li>Inequality and poverty</li>
        </ul>
        This correspond with the structure of the Tables in the In-depth, where there are three Pages, one for each category,
        containing the Tables listed under this category.<br />
        Consequently deselecting a category results in showing none of the Tables of the category (as the Page is not displayed).
        In addition, single Tables can be deselected from being displayed (in a displayed Page).
    </p>

    <h4>Changing comparison mode</h4>
    <p>
        By default all comparisons in the Tables refer to comparing (any) reforms with the baseline. This can however be changed by ticking
        <i>Compare with previous scenario</i>. If ticked, only the 1st reform is compared with the baseline, 
        all following reforms are compared with their predecessor. The order of reforms is determined by the order in which they are listed in the reforms table, 
        which is defined by their respective selection in the <a href="Settings_BaselinesReforms.htm">file-selection dialogue</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Saving a merged dataset</h4>
    <p>
        Ticking the checkbox <i>Save merged dataset</i> will, once the <i>Run</i> button is clicked, generate one file per baseline that contains
        the content of the baseline and corresponding reform output files, merged by using the variable <i>idperson</i>.<br />
        The input box below this checkbox allows for defining the folder where these merged datasets will be saved.
        The filename of the merged dataset is composed automatically by using the country short name and all system names (for example mt_2017_2018_2019.txt).
    </p>

    <h4>Changing settings for Fiscal/Distributional/Inequality &amp; poverty Tables</h4>
    <p>
        Selecting a sub menu of the <i>Advanced settings</i> menu opens a dialogue, which allows for defining the settings, and therewith the concrete content,
        of the Tables displayed by In-depth. For details see
        <a href="Settings_Fiscal.htm">Fiscal settings</a>,
        <a href="Settings_Distributional.htm">Distributional settings</a> and
        <a href="Settings_InequalityPoverty.htm">Inequality &amp; poverty settings</a>.<br />
        Moreover, the sub menu <i>Reset settings</i> allows for restoring the default settings for all Tables.<br />
    </p>

    <h4>Administrating settings</h4>
    <p>
        The tool allows for generating settings files which store the current settings for reuse in later sessions.
        The content of such a settings file consists of
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>the selection of Pages/Tables (as shown in the table on the right side of the dialogue)</li>
            <li>the settings defined in the <a href="Settings_Fiscal.htm">Fiscal</a>/<a href="Settings_Distributional.htm">Distributional</a>/
            <a href="Settings_InequalityPoverty.htm">Inequality &amp; poverty settings dialogues</a></li>
            <li>the path defined in the input box <i>Save merged dataset</i></li>
            <li>whether the merged dataset should be created once <i>Run</i> is clicked, or not</li>
            <li>the path defined in the input box <i>EUROMOD project folder</i></li>
            <li>whether comparisons should refer to the baseline or the previous reform</li>
            <li>the paths of baseline and reform output files as selected in the <a href="Settings_BaselinesReforms.htm">file-selection dialogue</a></li>
        </ul>
        The selected baseline and reform output files (as displayed in the tables on the left side of the dialogue) are not stored in the setting files.
     </p>
    <p>
        <br />When the tool is first loaded during a EUROMOD user interface session, it shows default settings.<br />
        The sub menus of the <i>File</i> menu allow for
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0">
            <li>loading any existing settings file with the sub menu <i>Load</i>.</li>
            <li>
                storing the current settings with the sub menu <i>Save</i>.
                If this menu is clicked for the first time during a session, it will ask for the path and filename for the settings file.
                On each further click it will use this selection.
            </li>
            <li>storing the current settings with the sub menu <i>Save As</i> always asks for the path and filename for the settings file.</li>
            <li>resetting and starting a new settings file with the sub menu <i>New</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        Note that the settings as well as the baseline and reform output files are kept in memory during the EUROMOD user interface session,
        meaning that, if the tool is closed and reopened it still shows all the user choices as before the closing.
